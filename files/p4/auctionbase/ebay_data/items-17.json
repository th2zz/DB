Bid with confidence - reliable, friendly video seller (See my Feedback ) THE MOVIE A young man's infatuation for a beautiful older woman blooms amidst the outbreak of World War II in this bittersweet comedy-drama from Italy. Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro) is a 13-year-old boy growing up in a small Sicilian community. Mussolini has risen to power and has declared war upon England and France, but Renato has other things on his mind -- mostly girls. While hanging out with his friends by the seashore, Renato spies Mal_na (Monica Bellucci), the daughter of one of his schoolteachers, whose husband Nino (Gaetano Aronica) is fighting with Mussolini's army. Renato is immediately obsessed with Mal_na and follows her like a lost puppy, spying on her whenever circumstances permit and imagining her as his co-star in elaborate erotic fantasies inspired by his favorite movies. Renato, however, is hardly the only man in town to be struck by Mal_na's charms, and her beauty leads to resentment from the women of the community. Mal_na's circumstances take a turn for the worst after her husband is reported to have died in combat, and she is forced to resort to prostitution to survive; she is brutally attacked by a pack of angry matrons and driven from town. Renato tries to keep track of her, and has some less than encouraging news to report when Nino turns out to be alive and finds his spouse is missing. Mal_na was written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, best known for the art-house hit Nuovo Cinema Paradiso. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide Cast: Monica Bellucci, Giuseppe Sulfaro, Luciano Federico, Matilde Piana, Pietro Notarianni, Gaetano Aronica Director: Giuseppe Tornatore SHIPPING Shipping to U.S. Mainland locations is by Priority Mail - $3.90 ; or First Class $2.70 (either method bubble-wrapped).

Rudy: Special Edition - Astin NEW DVD Rudy: Special Edition Description: All his life, people have told Rudy he's not good enough, not smart enough, not big enough. But nothing can stop his impossible dream of playing football for Notre Dame. From the time he's a young boy, Rudy (Sean Astin) is determined to join the Fighting Irish. But his blue-collar family only laughs at his ambitions -- they know Rudy will follow his father and brother to the local steel mill. And, for four long years after high school, he does just that. But some dreams won't die, as Rudy proves when he goes to heroic, occasionally hilarious, lengths to win admission to Notre Dame. Once there, he becomes a walk-on player, serving as little more than a human tackling dummy against the startling players. Bloodied but unbeaten, Rudy wins the respect of legendary coach Ara Parseghian and the other Irish players, who give him one shot at gridiron glory. An incredible, true story from the creators of Hoosiers, Rudy is an unforgettable testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man.

In the opening moments of the gleefully irreverent Shrek, a calm-voiced narrator reads a story from an engraved children's book. Seconds later, a page is torn and used as a paper substitute for a certain outhouse activity. This ain't your mother's animated fairy tale. Bordering on the naughty that children will no doubt love, this wildly funny tale based on William Steig's book has as its hero an irascible ogre named Shrek (Myers) who teams with a chatty talking donkey (a hilarious Murphy) to search for a princess (Diaz) imprisoned in a forbidding castle. Lovestruck dragons, magic spells and some twisted jokes (a frog blown up into a balloon!) await these mismatched adventurers. Shrek is a marvelous, one-of-a-kind children's classic thanks to some impressive animation, a slaphappy screenplay full of wonderful laughs (including a few well-placed pop-culture references), and three most delightful lead characters.

He would work his way up to aerialist with two circuses and also appear at the 1934 World's Fair. Jack then went to New York where he found work as a male model. Hollywood was his next stop and he entered films in 1938 as a bit player and stuntman. In 1940, at the suggestion of producer 'Eddie Small', Jack changed his first name to Clayton. He would appear in 'B' movies and serials through 1942. After the war, he would return to these supporting roles while concentrating on westerns. By 1949, he was playing the masked man, but that man was Zorro in Ghost of Zorro (1949). Clayton was hired to appear in the Television version of the popular radio show called \"The Lone Ranger\". One of the things that he had to do was to work on his voice so that he sounded like the radio Lone Ranger. When he got that right, he would become famous, along with Tonto, on the small screen. Clayton was \"The Lone Ranger\" from 1949 to 1952 until he was fired in a salary dispute. Along with Hop-a-long Cassidy, Clayton was one of the most popular Television western stars at the time. He was replaced by actor John Hart (I), but Hart's tenure was terminated after one season. It was during this time that Clayton would return to the big screen to enhance his movie career with such memorable movies as Radar Men From the Moon (1952) and Jungle Drums of Africa (1953). Hired back, at a higher salary, Clayton would be the Lone Ranger until the series ended in 1957 after 169 episodes. Clayton would appear in two color big screen movies, Lone Ranger, The (1956) and Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold, The (1958). After a lifetime of 'B' movie parts, Clayton found success in a Television Series and he would continue to make commercials and personal appearances as \"The Lone Ranger\" for the next three decades. At his appearances, Clayton would preach the Ranger's Code of good behavior which he also practiced as his image would never be tarnished with the scandals that affected other big stars. In 1975, Wrather Corporation, which owned the Television series and the rights to the title character, got a court order to stop Clayton from appearing in public as \"The Lone Ranger\". They planned to film a new big screen movie of the popular hero and did not want the public to confuse it's new star with the old one. After the film flopped, Clayton was given permission to again appear as \"The Lone Ranger\". You are bidding on a black and white 8-by-10-inch photo, autographed by Clayton Moore in black ink.

Includes the Tae Bo INSTRUCTIONAL tape, a 40 minute workout that includes all the instructions on how to do Tae Bo, Tae Bo BASICS , a 27-minute workout (5 minutes of warm-up, 18 minutes of Tae-Bo, and 4 minutes of cool-down) that will have your heart pounding and your body sweating. Next comes Advanced, a 57-minute workout that will have your heart racing, pulse pounding, and sweat glands working overtime. There's razzmatazz on the moves, with slightly more complicated combinations that should be fairly easy to master if you've completed the first two tapes. This video seriously raises the bar on the difficulty factor. In addition to the short warm-up, the cool-down, and the 30 minutes of Tae-Bo, Advanced Tae-Bo also includes 18 minutes of muscle-crunching floor work. You know you're in trouble when even the guys in the tape have trouble keeping up. Make sure you have truly mastered the first two tapes before attempting this one. The 8-Minute Workout is a highly compacted workout (actually 14 minutes long when you include warm-up and cool-down) for those days when you're too short on time for Basic or Advanced. This DVD is brand new & unopened! (It contains the footage from all 4 VHS tapes that are sold as a 4pack on 1 DVD). This DVD is NOT a copy, it is the original manufacturer's DVD in its original packaging and shrinkwrap.

Not an ex-rental. Video and cover is excellent, plays perfect. Italian with yellow english subtitles. Rated \"R\" - 107 Mins, Hi-Fi Stereo/Digitally Mastered, Color. _______________________________________________________ This Italian film was released in 1995 and slowly made its way around the world; its English title is The Star Maker. Like the Oscar-winning Cinema Paradiso by the same writer-director, Guiseppe Tornatore, it's drenched in the filmmaker's love for cinema. In Sicily in the early 1950s, Joe Morelli (Sergio Castellitto) is a con man who travels by truck from village to village posing as a film company representative. For a fee, he offers the rubes screen tests, using passages from a script of Gone with the Wind and encouraging their hopes with lines such as \"Success awaits you!\" Morelli's camera brings out people's hidden sides, including a soldier's war trauma, a woman's protests at being accused of prostitution, and a policeman who recites poetry. Begging for a chance at the stardom Morelli purportedly offers, Beata (Tiziana Lodato) asks Morelli to take her with him. _______________________________________________________ Combine to save on shipping.

They generally have ads in various sizes for newspapers and display all the variations in available posters. They also have a synopsis and other information on the film like stories on the stars and the production. They often contain info on other promotional items like lobby cards, photos, radio spots and standups that are available to the theater owner.

Posters are shipped inside a polyethelene sleeve and flat or folded pieces also have acid free backer boards. We pack in padded boxes and poster tubes. Flat and rolled pieces cannot be shipped in the same package and will require an additional shipping charge. WE SHIP WORLDWIDE! For international shipping please e-mail us for rates Poster Grading We list any flaws we can find. If a poster is listed as just 'near mint' then it is generally like new with no flaws unless mentioned. Near Mint - Near Mint is as good as it gets. I do not grade mint as nothing is truly mint unless it is sealed in plastic from the factory. Near mint includes posters that are like new and were never used or were very carefully used. Image area should be near perfect but may include one or two of the following problems; a few clean pinholes in margins and some light edge wear from storage; may have some slight or very small imperfections in image. Factory folded posters may have some slight wear on the folds from storage. Excellent - A poster which has been carefully used. Image should be clear of any defects except one or two small flaws such as clean pinholes or small scuffs or wrinkles. May have pinholes in margins or one to two small and clean pieces of tape in the corners. May have some very small tears or chips in the edges. Very Good - Average used poster. May have pinholes in the corners; some scuffing or light wear in the image area. Heavier wear on the fold lines of folded posters is acceptable. May have small tears and chips in the edges. Poster should display nicely and if highly collectible would make a good candidate for linen backing with light restoration. Good - A poster that shows its flaws. Would benefit from restoration. Image is all there but may have staining or fading which seriously effects the image quality. May have some tearing and major separation at the fold lines. Poor to Fair - A poster which needs major restoration. May have some pieces of the image area missing or badly stained. Satisfaction guaranteed! If not satisfied with item contact me within 3 days of receipt and you may return your item for full refund of purchase price.

Flat and rolled pieces cannot be shipped in the same package and will require an additional shipping charge. WE SHIP WORLDWIDE! For international shipping please e-mail us for rates Poster Grading We list any flaws we can find. If a poster is listed as just 'near mint' then it is generally like new with no flaws unless mentioned. Near Mint - Near Mint is as good as it gets. I do not grade mint as nothing is truly mint unless it is sealed in plastic from the factory. Near mint includes posters that are like new and were never used or were very carefully used. Image area should be near perfect but may include one or two of the following problems; a few clean pinholes in margins and some light edge wear from storage; may have some slight or very small imperfections in image. Factory folded posters may have some slight wear on the folds from storage. Excellent - A poster which has been carefully used. Image should be clear of any defects except one or two small flaws such as clean pinholes or small scuffs or wrinkles. May have pinholes in margins or one to two small and clean pieces of tape in the corners. May have some very small tears or chips in the edges. Very Good - Average used poster. May have pinholes in the corners; some scuffing or light wear in the image area. Heavier wear on the fold lines of folded posters is acceptable. May have small tears and chips in the edges. Poster should display nicely and if highly collectible would make a good candidate for linen backing with light restoration. Good - A poster that shows its flaws. Would benefit from restoration. Image is all there but may have staining or fading which seriously effects the image quality. May have some tearing and major separation at the fold lines. Poor to Fair - A poster which needs major restoration. May have some pieces of the image area missing or badly stained. Satisfaction guaranteed! If not satisfied with item contact me within 3 days of receipt and you may return your item for full refund of purchase price.

This set includes The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, The Godfather Part III, plus a Bonus disc containing over 3 hours of exclusive features. More Info WebID: M1874670 Mfr. Part Number IMPORT More Information The Godfather Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. STARRING: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire. DIRECTED BY: Francis Ford Coppola. The Godfather Part II (2 Discs) This brilliant companion piece to the original - The Godfather - continues the saga of two generation of successive power within the Corleone family. Coppola tells two stories in Part II: the roots and rise of a young Don Vito, played with uncanny ability by Robert De Niro, and the ascension of Michael (Al Pacino) as the new Don. Reassembling many of the talents who helped make The Godfather, Coppola has produced a movie of staggering magnitude and vision, and undeniably the best sequel ever made. Robert De Niro won an Oscar; the film received six Academy Awards, including Best Picture of 1974. STARRING: Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Robert DeNiro, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Lee Strasberg. DIRECTED BY: Francis Ford Coppola. The Godfather Part III One of the greatest sagas in movie history continues! In this third film in the epic Corleone trilogy, Al Pacino reprises the role of powerful family leader Michael Corleone. Now in his 60's, Michael is dominated by two passions: freeing his family from crime and finding a suitable successor. That successor could be fiery Vincent (Andy Garcia)... but he may also be the spark that turns Michael's hope of business legitimacy into an inferno of mob violence. STARRING: Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Sofia Coppola, Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, Bridget Fonda, George Hamilton. DIRECTED BY: Francis Ford Coppola. All three films include the following features: Dynamic menus, Scene selection, Audio commentary by Francis Ford Coppola, Widescreen format, Enhanced for 16x9 TVs, English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, Chinese Mono, English subtitles.

Flat and rolled pieces cannot be shipped in the same package and will require an additional shipping charge. WE SHIP WORLDWIDE! For international shipping please e-mail us for rates Poster Grading We list any flaws we can find. If a poster is listed as just 'near mint' then it is generally like new with no flaws unless mentioned. Near Mint - Near Mint is as good as it gets. I do not grade mint as nothing is truly mint unless it is sealed in plastic from the factory. Near mint includes posters that are like new and were never used or were very carefully used. Image area should be near perfect but may include one or two of the following problems; a few clean pinholes in margins and some light edge wear from storage; may have some slight or very small imperfections in image. Factory folded posters may have some slight wear on the folds from storage. Excellent - A poster which has been carefully used. Image should be clear of any defects except one or two small flaws such as clean pinholes or small scuffs or wrinkles. May have pinholes in margins or one to two small and clean pieces of tape in the corners. May have some very small tears or chips in the edges. Very Good - Average used poster. May have pinholes in the corners; some scuffing or light wear in the image area. Heavier wear on the fold lines of folded posters is acceptable. May have small tears and chips in the edges. Poster should display nicely and if highly collectible would make a good candidate for linen backing with light restoration. Good - A poster that shows its flaws. Would benefit from restoration. Image is all there but may have staining or fading which seriously effects the image quality. May have some tearing and major separation at the fold lines. Poor to Fair - A poster which needs major restoration. May have some pieces of the image area missing or badly stained. Satisfaction guaranteed! If not satisfied with item contact me within 3 days of receipt and you may return your item for full refund of purchase price.

Largely misunderstood, these fascinating creatures can teach us many valuable lessons about the balance of nature. In this exciting video you're able to see nature's hunters in a new light. Watch as lions, cobras, pythons, use what nature has instilled upon them_the instinct to kill. The thrill of the hunt. The excitement of the chase. Join us on our journey through the tropical forests of Thailand, where predatory reptiles stalk the forest floor in search for unwary prey. Travel to North America to witness the awesome power of the alligator. With ancestors dating back over 200 million years, the North American alligator is the closest thing to a living dinosaur. Visit the Mojave Desert at night, the time when most animals are active. Here you will see the desert scorpion in action. This predator as well as others have evolved certain attributes that make it uniquely effective in stalking its prey while remaining undetected. These are just some of the exciting creatures you will experience in this close-up fast paced look at the raw nature of the animal in all of us.

MIKE BRACKEN, EOpinions: \"Caligula is an odd juxtaposition of disparate images. In any given scene, the viewer can see actors of the stature of [Malcolm] McDowell, Helen Mirren (who plays Caesonia, Caligula_s wife), and Peter O_Toole surrounded by hordes of unabashed couples. \"Even by today_s standards, Caligula is a strong film guaranteed to offend the squeamish: a castration (fed to hungry dogs), numerous decapitations, disemboweling, and so on. This was the old Rome as depicted in ancient texts. \"It_s also a movie that_s guaranteed to become one of my guilty pleasures. It_s hard not to like McDowell_s gratuitous performance as he capers around the film_s elaborate sets carrying on like a madman. Not to mention, any film that features such copious amounts of both togetherness and bloodletting is bound to make my cult favorites list.\" DANIEL KRAUS, Salon: \"Today the notorious 1979 film remains the only major motion picture to couple respected, eminent film actors (Gielgud, Peter O'Toole, Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren) with no-holds-barred Roman decadence. \"The 20th-anniversary edition of Caligula may be digitally remastered and enhanced with Dolby stereo sound, but at its core it is as raw as ever.\" TLA FILM & RADIO GUIDE: \"For those chagrined at having missed the decadence and excess of the Roman Empire, this epic is as satisfying as a massage by Michelle Pfeiffer.\" M. CHRISTER, 100 Must See, ViolentVision: \"I really think Tinto Brass is up there with the best of the Italian directors. \"The film is epic, has enormous settings, lots of extras and is as long as these movies tend to be. As a historical drama Caligula works fairly well, but it's the scenes involving the Romans' decadence that really hit the spot. What in previous films only could be suggested, is here shown in full detail. It is a film that should be seen by anyone that likes Italian film. \"You like historical pictures? \"See it! \"You like Helen Mirren, Malcom McDowell and other English stars? \"See it! \"You like Tinto Brass, John Steiner and Adriana Asti and other Italian stars? \"See it! \"You curious about the extremes of man's nature. \"See it!\" DIALOGUE Caligula (Malcolm McDowell): I have existed from the morning of the world and I shall exist until the last star falls from the heavens.

Winters' first film credits were decorative bit parts in such 1940s movies as Knickerbocker Holiday (1944) and Tonight and Every Night (1945). Her first big break was landing a costarring role with Ronald Colman in A Double Life (1947), as the mistress and unfortunate victim of the actor-gone-mad. In the aftermath of that film she was often cast as vulnerable victim types, such as Myrtle in The Great Gatsby (1949) and Alice Tripp in A Place in the Sun (1951), but she also played her share of sexpots, including the title role in Frenchie (1950), a reworking of Destry Rides Again that cast her in the Marlene Dietrich part. completely informal shot of the Academy Award winning actress NO RESERVE UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE \"In Hollywood, all the marriages are happy.

POSTER INFORMATION: THIS IS THE US ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER. IT MEASURES 27x40 (APPROX) AND IS AN ORIGINAL STUDIO RE-ISSUED MOVIE POSTER (NOT A POSTER-HOUSE REPRINT!!!). When the studios started to realize there was a mass market for their movie posters, they have gone back and re-issued several of them. This poster is one of them. It is identical to the first printing done by the studio. Only an appraiser could probably tell the difference. Now, as far as collectability goes, to give you an example - First printings for GOODFELLAS posters sell for about $250 each (if you can even find one). The studio realized that this was not appropriate for the average person who wanted the poster for their wall and so they went back and re-issued the poster in mass quantity and so the value of the re-issues is not like the first printings, yet you get basically the same quality. This provides an affordable alternative for someone to obtain a poster for a movie like GOODFELLAS. Again, this is NOT a poster-house reprint. Those are photocopies of the originals and the quality is not nearly as good. I offer a complete satisfaction guarantee on all my products!!!

Brilliantly blending painstaking reenactments of these storied engagements with fascinating commentary from authors and experts, Legends of the Northwest goes to the heart of the action, exploring the strategies and profiling the individuals that left their mark on history. Some of the images on these videos are spectacular. The four videos in this collector's set include: Rogers_ Rangers - The irregular Colonial forces who revolutionized battle tactics and were the forerunners of today_s special forces units. Pontiac_s Rebellion - The attempts by the great chief to fight the spread of the Europeans. Long Knives - The story of George Rogers Clark_s campaign against more than the British on the western frontier during the Revolutionary War. Tecumseh: The Dream Of Confederacy - Tecumseh_s attempt to unite all the tribes of the Midwest and, allied with the British, to take back the lands lost through illegal treaties. I believe this set is out of print, since I no longer see it offered on the History Channel_s listing. The actual name of the series is _Frontier: Legends of the Old Northwest_, although on the cassettes it says only _Frontier_. The videos have been viewed a few times, but still have excellent sound and picture quality. Boxes and tapes are in like-new condition. This will be a great addition to your video library.

Is it a serious documentary about the Catholic priesthood? No, it's Father Ted. Right-thinking people everywhere cheered in the 1980s as The Young Ones beat the sitcom format senseless, yet the once twee genre returned reinvigorated in the 90s, first as Men Behaving Badly (1991-98), then the affably surreal Father Ted. Ted's the normal one, as evidenced by his moving Song for Europe entry, \"My Lovely Horse\"--a modern classic if ever there wasn't one. In total there are five cassock-splittingly funny episodes of C4's finest comedy on The Very Best of Father Ted. Gasp as \"poor idiot boy\" Father Dougal becomes a rollerblading fiend in \"Cigarettes And Alcohol And Rollerblading\"; be amazed as super Ted saves Craggy Island from an deadly milk-float in the stunning blockbuster sequel \"Speed 3\" (well, it's faster and more fun than Speed 2); fall off the window-sill as devoted housekeeper Mrs Doyle utters the line that's almost Shakespearean in its sublimity, \"Cup of tea, Father?\". Meanwhile, Father Jack doesn't need an excuse to hit the bottle (or smash one over someone's head) in any episode. Not saying Mass has probably never been so much fun.

We accept paypal FULLSCREEN VERSION Under a thick carpet of green-dyed yak fur and wonderfully expressive Rick Baker makeup, Jim Carrey is up to all of his old tricks (and some nifty new ones) in this live-action movie of Dr. Seuss's holiday classic. He commands the title role with equal parts madness, mayhem, pathos, and improvisational genius, channeling Grinchness through his own screen persona so smoothly that fans of both Carrey and Dr. Seuss will be thoroughly satisfied. Adding to the fun is a perfectly pitched back-story sequence (accompanied by Anthony Hopkins's narration) that explains how the Grinch came to hate Christmas, with a heart \"two sizes too small.\" Ron Howard proves a fine choice for the director's chair with a keen balance of comedy, sentiment, and light-hearted Seussian whimsy. Production designer Michael Corenblith gloriously realizes the wackiness of Whoville architecture, and his rendition of the Grinch's Mt. Crumpit lair is a marvel of cartoonish, subterranean grime. Then there's Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), the thoughtful imp who rallies her village to recapture the pure spirit of Christmas and melts the gift-stealing Grinch's cold, cold heart. You've even got a dog (the Grinch's good-natured mongrel, Max) who's been perfectly cast, so what's not to like about this dazzling yuletide movie? The production gets a bit overwhelmed by its own ambition, and the citizens of Whoville (including Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Molly Shannon, and Bill Irwin) pale in comparison to Carrey's inspired lunacy, but who cares? If a movie can unleash Jim Carrey at his finest, revamp the Grinch story, and still pay tribute to the legacy of Dr. Seuss, you can bet it qualifies as rousing entertainment.

MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE KARAOKE VCD ON YOUR PLAYER: About Video CD... What is a Video Compact Disc or VCD ? A Video Compact Disc or VCD is a compact disc that plays movies instead of music only. It is in multi-platform format which means you can use many different kinds of equipment to play them, such as most of the DVD players with Vcd (MPEG-1 format) playing capability. VCDs look exactly like a CD or CD-ROM except that it stores video/audio clips using the compressed and standardized MPEG-1 (Motion Picture Expert Group) format. It was jointly developed by Philips and Sony and were introduced in 1993. A single disc can hold 74 minutes of video but usually only 50 to 60 minutes is actually used. How to play Karaoke (Sing Along music) from a Video Compact Disc or VCD ? In your computer, VCD, most DVD or other players, you will be able to see and listen to both movie and music, by default. This is similar to watching and enjoying an MTV on the display screen. You can adjust the audio setting to either left, middle or right, from the computer player program audio setting, or the remote control of your Vcd or DVD player. Left audio channel: This is normally the movie with background music but without SINGER to sing. Now you can begin to enjoy the magic of karaoke and sing along with the background music (by using a connected microphone to a stereo system). You will be able to read the dynamic LYRICS of the song from the display screen, which will guide you thorough the whole song. Middle (Stereo) audio channel: This is a stereo setting where you can enjoy the whole music performance by another artist. Listen to how this artist performing this song, and later you can play the song again and adjust the audio to left channel and sing along by yourself. Sing like a superstar. Right audio channel: This is an audio setting similar to middle audio channel, by normally the singer's sound is higher in volume. Both singer's vocal and background music can be listened. Lyrics and background movie are displayed in all audio channels. Why is VCD gaining popularity in America, Europe and Australia ? VCDs are very popular in Asia and are gaining popularity in America, Europe and Australia. Nowadays, VCDs have practically replaced video cassettes in Asia. The main reason is because VCD is cheap compared to DVDs and the quality is even better than VHS. It can also last much longer than VHS and has no drop in sound/picture quality when stored for a long time. It is much smaller in size, easier to store, that is why it is ideal for movie collectors! One good aspect is that it can be played on DVD, LD players, a computer and many other devices. What equipment do I need to play VCD ? VCDs can be played on VCD players but it is not quite popular yet in other parts of the world except Asia. The second way is to play VCDs on DVD players. DVD movies are encoded using a compression technique called MPEG-2. Whereas, VCDs are encoded in MPEG-1. Because of the similarity of encoding/ compression technique, most, but not all DVD players can play VCD and DVD. For example, SONY DVP-S3000 and SONY DVP-S7000 and PIONEER DVD PLAYER DV-505. On the other hand, VCD players cannot play DVDs. You also can play VCDs on your PC if your computer is properly equipped. Below are the different kinds of equipment which will play Video CDs: 1. VCD Players. 2. DVD Players with VCD capabilities. For example, SONY DVP-S3000 and SONY DVP-S7000 and PIONEER DVD PLAYER DV-505. 3. Computers. You need to have a MPEG player software, but if you want to get high picture quality, you need to install a MPEG accelerator card accompanied by a good video card. 4. Playstation Consoles with VCD Add-On [ a.k.a the Movie Card ] 5. Saturn Consoles with VCD Add-On 6. Doctor V64 / CD 64 7. Some CD-I Players 8. Some 3DO Game Consoles 9. Some Laser Disc Players What are the advantages of VCD? 1.VCD is multi-platform. 2.Random Access for quick search. 3.Multiple audio/voice tracks for multilingual support. 4.It's a cheaper alternative for DVDs and Laser Discs. 5.Its the exact size of your regular CDs and its so much easier to store compared to VHS. 6.Its picture and sound WILL NOT deteriorate with time, unlike VHS so if you are a movie collector,you can keep your collection for a very long time. What is the quality of VCD like ? Because of the capacity to hold more data, DVD movies are of more superior quality compared to VCDs. DVD can hold up to 26 more times (6 Gigabytes) of data as compared with VCD (650 Megabytes). One of the objectives of the MPEG-1 standard for VCD was to get the quality comparable to S-VHS. In practice, picture quality when using a VCD players may somehow be almost as good as laser disc, depending on the encoding. VCDs are playable on any machine capable of playing VCD anywhere in the world. This is because VCDs have no incompatibility problem caused by different formats such as PAL, NTSC & SECAM, and also do not have lock-out (region) codes that disallow you playing movies that are not bought in your region. How can I play VCD on my computer Windows ? Almost any computer can play VCDs because they are based on MPEG technology. You only need a basic pentium PC (minimum pentium 166), a 2xCD-ROM drive, a good video card with 2MB or more and a software-only MPEG decoder. There are two most popular MPEG decoder software that is from Xing Technology called Xing MPEG and Activemovie from Microsoft. You can try out Xing's latest version of MPEG program by downloading it from XINGTECH. . This software is highly recommended to play VCDs. If you are running a windows NT/95/98 machine you'd probably have the media player as a plug-in in Internet Explorer. Just follow these simple steps: 1. Insert VCD into your CD-ROM drive. 2. Open XingMPEG player. 3. Click at File and then Open. From the Look in menu: Choose the cd-rom drive. Open the Mpegav folder and you'll get either .dat or .avi files. Click at it and ENJOY your movie! Windows Media Player / Active Movie supports popular video and audio formats including AVI video, QuickTime, WAV, MIDI, AU, and AIFF. It also supports playback of MPEG video and audio. With the support of MPEG video, ActiveMovie gives you television-quality video on your computer. To enhance the performance of your computer, get a MPEG card from your local computer shop to relief the decoding work from your main CPU. That way, the movie you are watching will play more smoothly. Another recomendable software to play VCDs is Taiwan Cyber Link's The Software-only VCD PowerPlayer.

Borg had four Wimbledon titles under his belt, so was the firm favourite. McEnroe however had shown his potential two years earlier, reaching the semi-final from the qualifying stages. Vastly contrasting in character, Borg remained calm and composed, whilst McEnroe was openly emotional and determined. McEnroe made a swift start to take the opening set 6-1, but Borg fought back against the left-hander's net attack and won the net two sets. In the fourth, at 5-4, 40-15, it seemed that Borg had secured his fifth Wimbledon title, but McEnroe hadn't finished. He produced two fearless shots to escape defeat and then went on to play one of the greatest tie-breaks in tennis history. Borg failed to convert five more Championship points and McEnroe leveled the match to make it two sets all by winning the tie-break 18-16. The battle continued, but eventually it was the Swede who triumphed after 3 hours and 53 minutes, taking the final set 8-6. Borg had won his fifth consecutive Wimbledon title. He hurled his racket into the air and sank to his knees in sheer relief. Video is in NTSC -VHS(American format) for VCRs in the USA/Canadian market. Video comes in UK style plastic case.

DOWNTOWN 81 not only captures one of the most interesting and lively artists of the twentieth century as he is poised for fame, but it is a slice of life from one of the most exciting periods in American culture, with the emergence of new wave music, new painting, hip hop and graffiti art. The film is a day in the life of a young artist who needs to raise money to reclaim the apartment from which he has been evicted. He wanders the downtown streets carrying a painting he hopes to sell, encountering friends, whose lives (and performances) we peek into. He finally manages to sell his painting to a wealthy female admirer, but he's paid by check. Low on cash, he spends the evening wandering from club to club, looking for a beautiful girl he had met earlier, so he'll have a place to spend the night. DOWNTOWN 81 was shot in 1980-81, directed by photographer Edo Bertoglio and written by Glenn O'Brien. But in 1981 business problems interrupted the completion of post-production, and parts of the film were lost in Europe. Finally, after much searching, the missing materials were located in 1998. Post-production was begun in 1999 and finished in 2000. The cast includes Deborah Harry, and leading bands of the era including Kid Creole and the Coconuts, James White and the Blacks, DNA, Tuxedomoon, the Plastics and Walter Steding and the Dragon People. Also heard on the soundtrack are rap legend Melle Mel, John Lurie, Lydia Lunch, Suicide, Vincent Gallo, Kenny Burrell and Basquiat's own band, Gray.

Its a dark and eerie night, and a state trooper is called to an emergency. His siren blares as he speeds in the direction of the trouble. He quickly sets up a roadblock on a mountain byway and commences stopping all vehicles passing into the area. The first car contains a wise and compassionate old man and his vulnerable granddaughter. In the next is a partygirl and her hipster boyfriend. They are followed by a truck whose drivers have picked up a young hitchhiker who is wanted for murder. Then comes a dysfunctional married couple on their way to catch a plane to Mexico City. All of these people are unaware that they are in for the most terrifying night of their lives. The cop receives word that a \"yellow alert\" is in effect. This only can mean one thing: America will momentarily be under nuclear attack. All major urban areas are to be evacuated and martial law is in effect. Whats more, it just may be that the spot where all of these characters have come together is ground zero! Are they all going to die? Can they do anything to save themselves? As they interact, their personalities and agendas are revealed and the result is at once a provocative and pulse-pounding drama and an intriguing byproduct of the Cold War era. 72 minutes. ntsc b&w Sorry we do not accept U.S postal money orders as they are non-negotiable outside the USA.

Studio One Rockers features many legendary Studio One tracks brought together for the first time by Soul Jazz Records. From the beginning of Reggae, when the Skatalites developed a new sound of Ska in 1962 up until today, Studio One has been the number one innovator in Jamaican music. Included in this compilation are classic Ska tracks (\"Phoenix City\"), Rocksteady (\"Feel Like Jumping\"), Roots music (\"Truth and Rights\"), Dancehall (Freddy McGregor, Michigan and Smiley) and many more.

A female co-worker is obsessed with him, but he ignores and avoids her. He leaves his acting resume in the hotel room of a woman screenwriter, who is casting for a TV movie based on the true story of her deceased brother. She hires him to play the lead and the two begin an affair. She becomes increasingly distraught as it becomes evident that the movie's producer is changing her story. Egoyan's trademark tangle of bizarre relationships surrounds the protagonists on their way to a mind-blowing conclusion. A hypnotic, fascinating film.

This 3-piece kit is a terrific value. It is nicely packaged and complete. First, you get the Basic Dance Video which features the incredible Neena and Veena, identical twins and simply fabulous teachers. It is from the acclaimed Sensual Art of Bellydance series. In this video, Neena and Veena will show you all the basic moves to get you belly dancing in about 45 minutes. Use it for basic exercise or as a primer for performing. The step by step instructions are isolated and taught slowly, so you can learn each one's subtleties. As you become more familiar, you develop speed and expression. The video by itself is one of our most popular auction items. The kit also contains a hard to find and traditional Hip Scarf. This beautiful costume piece jingles and undulates as you dance. It can be worn on the hips, or over the shoulders as a scarf. The Hip Scarf is 50\" x 30\" x 30\", triangular in shape, and has more than 300 individually sewn dime sized lightweight \"coins\" sewn on completely around it. It is made in Egypt of blue polyester chiffon fabric as shown. Rounding out the kit is a Basic Dance Rhythms CD with 9 bellydance musical selections with various tempi to enhance you exercise or performance. The music is varied and exotic. I especially like the re-arrangement of the symphonic Scheherezade suite originally written by Rimsky-Korsakof a century ago. The CD is about 35 minutes long. This set makes a wonderful gift - if you can bear to give it away! I am also offering a second kit for advanced belly dancers. It has a matching veil and finger zills, plus advanced video.
