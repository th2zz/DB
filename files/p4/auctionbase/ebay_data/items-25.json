Length Coat _ Elegant Black Broadtail Lamb! Description: Up for auction, I have a fabulous RARE full length, black, genuine Broadtail, fur coat. The label reads ARNOLD CONSTABLE - FIFTH AVENUE. I have seen this fur (correctly or incorrectly) sold on Ebay as Persian Lamb, Caracul, Curly Lamb, Krimmer, astrakhan, and Swakara, however, the correct name is 'Broadtail'. A little history on Broadtail,...It is the black pelt of a Karakul sheep that was born too soon and is therefor often referred to as unborn lamb. Broadtail is actually a more prized, and a lot harder to come by, fur than the other lambs. In the market, it is the most expensive of the Karakul pelts. It has a flat (lower nap) silky velvet-like surface and a wavy rippled ( moir_ velvet-like ) a ppearance. Most Broadtail skins are produced in central and southwestern Asia, southwestern Africa, India, and southeastern Europe. A few are produced in Texas. A full length Broadtail coat truly is a rare find. Generally, Broadtail is only seen in the shorter, mink cuffed, mink collar ed jacket style your grandmother so proudly wore to the theater. If this coat fit me, you would not be seeing it on listed on EBay. The style of the coat is very current. The sleeves are a regular full length ( not 3/4 ) and are fashioned with windbreakers - the inside lining is elasticized at the bottom - to keep the wind out and you snug. A great feature! The center front has a hook and loop closure. There are 2 velvet lined pockets on either side that look like they've never had anything in them. The quality of the pelts is comparable to my Schiaparelli s. The fur is in excellent, soft, shiny, condition and the skins are supple. There is no drying or shedding. The lining is made out of a black jacquard fabric - feels and looks like silk but I'm not 100% sure it is - and is in pristine condition. The former owner's name - Hilda - is embroidered into the lining. This coat can be dressed up or down! Wear it..... ....On the weekend over a pair of black Banana Republic jeans, a thick fitted camel cabled cashmere turtleneck sweater, and black leather ankle shoe boots. ....To work (over the holiday season), with a long black suede skirt and a fitted red ribbed cashmere turtleneck. ....To dinner over slate charcoal grey velvet pants, a cashmere twinset, and a string of gray baroque pearls.....So Grace Kelly - ish. Dress it up with a black Mongolian Lamb boa, a dyed fox boa, or a black mink collar as I have in the 5th pic. If you haven't owned a Broadtail coat yet, now is the time. They are as warm as Shearling. When the temperature dips and the wind kicks up, there is nothing that will keep you as toasty warm as one of these fur coats. The condition is excellent. There are no strange odors. The only 'issues' I can find are that 3 of the loops at the center front closure are missing. They are a standard type of fur loop so you will easily find a replacement at a fabric / sewing supplies store or from a furrier. There is also a 1 inch area at the underarm seam that needs restitching. If I am able to get to it, I will have my seamstress take care of this before I ship but because of the time of year it is, I cant promise. ***Sorry, the Russian sable mink collar displayed with the coat is not included in this auction. If you like the look though, scope out Ebay for one. There always seem to be some up for auction. This coat will be shipped to you from my smoke free home. Measuremen ts: All measurements are approximate. There is no size tag in this jacket. I would put it at a Large (L, 10, 12) though that because of the style could also fit a Medium ( 8 ) or XL ( 14 ) depending on how you like your outerwear to fit. Please go by the measurements though. All measurements taken on the outside of the coat. Center back neckline seam to hem = 43 inches long - not including the collar Shoulder to shoulder = 16 inches - measured across the top Bust = 43 inches around - measured on the outside of the coat Sweep (Bottom edge with coat buttoned) = 62 inches around Sleeve length = 24 inches - shoulder seam to sleeve edge uncuffed / 21 1/4 inches with cuff fully rolled back. _ _ Please check my M E page, before bidding, for all the terms and conditions of this auction. .....

Please visit our many other auctions BID WITH CONFIDENCE! 2,000+ Positive Feedbacks! If this is your first time bidding with us, please read our FAQ Page. If you cannot comply with the terms of the auction, please do not bid. FAQ HOW CAN YOU SELL SO CHEAP? WHERE DO YOU GET THE STUFF? We specialize in the remarketing of New, Used, and Distressed Merchandise. These items are from overstock warehouses, company liquidations, freight claims, bulk auctions, and insurance purchases. This means that some items may be missing manuals, cords, cables, disks, factory packaging and/or may have light to severe damage. Please read the ENTIRE auction and ask ALL questions prior to bidding. We suggest you call or visit the manufacturer's page for detailed information. Items may have come originally with accessories such as remotes, cables, or batteries. If it's not listed in the description, don't expect it. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY \"UNTESTED\" AND \"AS-IS\"? Please understand that our warehouse does not have the equipment, facilities, or time to fully test every item. We offer a \"cursory\" inspection on all items and list our findings in the auction description. We supply all available Make/Model information for you to review and research. Please do your own research prior to bidding. All items and contents are described to the best of our ability. Unless the auction description states differently, these items are sold and \"as-is\". We reserve the right to refuse sale or service for any reason. WHEN SHOULD I SEND PAYMENT? Payment is due within 10 days of the closing of the auction. Otherwise, we reserve the right to re-post or re-sell this item and request credit from eBay, at our discretion. Acceptable forms of payment include Cashier Checks, Money Orders, and Bank Wire Transfers. If necessary, we can accept personal or company checks. We normally ship within 3-5 business days for certified funds. We hold all checks for 7-10 working days for validation. We do not use I-Escrow or any other escrow company. Other payment terms may be available and will be disclosed in our \"Payment Email\" that will be sent to you at the end of the auction. Unless otherwise stated, Sales are final. All others we offer a 50% restocking fee for any returns, less shipping and paypal fees (if applicable). I WON MORE THAN ONE ITEM OR I AM BIDDING ON MORE OF YOUR AUCTIONS. SHOULD I WAIT AND SEND PAYMENTS ALL AT ONCE? I MAY SAVE A BUCK OR TWO? Although we appreciate you bidding on more of our items, it would be more efficient if you sent in each payment as the item closes. We use an automated system and it sends out confirmations, feedbacks, Non-Pay Bidder Reminders, and other eBay related operations automatically. That's why it's so important to get payment in within 10 days of the close of the auction and keep auctions as separate transactions. If you delay, you may get warnings from eBay or you may actually lose your item because it got re-posted. We also do not combine shipping fees because we ship from various warehouses and cannot guarantee that items will be shipped together. Also, it requires us to manually do each multiple order and that interferes with our automated system. Therfore, we do not combine shipping fees. If you get multiple items shipped together, it's just a matter of luck and chance. HOW DO YOU SHIP WITH AND WHAT IF I'M OUTSIDE YOUR STANDARD SHIPPING AREA? We ship via UPS Ground from Connecticut, 06804. For books, videos, CDs video games and other media we may offer Media Mail Rates. If available, it would be listed in the auction description. We cannot ship to PO BOXES or Military APO addresses. If you are outside the 48 contiguous US states, shipping fees are more. Please contact us for the estimated rates prior to bidding. PAYPAL USERS: We can ONLY ship to verified Paypal addresses. If you want it shipped to a different address send your payment via the mail. Whenever possible, we will provide shipping weights and/or fixed shipping costs. Fixed shipping rates are for shipping within the 48 contiguous states. If you are outside of this area, contact us prior to bidding. Shipping will be higher. Sorry, we do not combine shipping fees. It screws up our automated accounting and shipping programs. HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN YOU RECEIVE MY PAYMENT OR WHEN MY ITEM IS SHIPPED? We issue the buyer a Positive Feedback the day your payment is received and entered. You can use this as a reference of when your item will be shipped. If you provide us an email, we will email you a tracking number. All shipping questions should be directed to shipping@highendequipment.com. We are no longer responsible for items once it is picked up by the courier. If damage occurs during transit, we will assist in the claims process. No product refunds will be issued until the claim is paid. Shipping fees are not refundable for any reason. ANYTHING ELSE BEFORE I BID? Please read all the information on the auction and do your research prior to bidding. If you have any questions, please call our office at 203-740-9111 or email us at inquiry@highendequipment.com. By placing a bid on this auction you are confirming that you have read all the information, asked all your questions, and understand the terms of this auction. NICE FEEDBACK RATING, BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY NEGATIVES? The fact of the matter is, we are only human. We do make mistakes. We also use automated systems and internet based platforms to help automate the selling process. We can fix our human errors, unfortunately the others are not as easy. We can't fix external programs like eBay or AuctionWatch. Most problems can be resolved with one phone call. We try our best to service all customers and when we make a mistake, we take care of it. Not every buyer gives us the opportunity to correct for our mistakes. Most of our negatives are from new users who don't understand or respect the rules of eBay. They don't read the auctions and are not very good shoppers. If a problem comes up, they SLAM a Negative Feedback and not even give us a chance to address the issue. Basically, when we are given the opportunity, we take care of everybody. Hey, you can't be an eBay PowerSeller without doing something right! MAN, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS RETURN EMAILS FASTER? Everyone in our company travels frequently to find the best deals to bring to you on eBay. Therefore, it is difficult for us to return emails in a timely manner. If all else fails, call our office for assistance. 203-740-9111. Office hours are Mon-Fri 9am-5pm EST. We strive to bring you the best items at the very best prices possible!

Please visit our many other auctions BID WITH CONFIDENCE! 2,000+ Positive Feedbacks! If this is your first time bidding with us, please read our FAQ Page. If you cannot comply with the terms of the auction, please do not bid. FAQ HOW CAN YOU SELL SO CHEAP? WHERE DO YOU GET THE STUFF? We specialize in the remarketing of New, Used, and Distressed Merchandise. These items are from overstock warehouses, company liquidations, freight claims, bulk auctions, and insurance purchases. This means that some items may be missing manuals, cords, cables, disks, factory packaging and/or may have light to severe damage. Please read the ENTIRE auction and ask ALL questions prior to bidding. We suggest you call or visit the manufacturer's page for detailed information. Items may have come originally with accessories such as remotes, cables, or batteries. If it's not listed in the description, don't expect it. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY \"UNTESTED\" AND \"AS-IS\"? Please understand that our warehouse does not have the equipment, facilities, or time to fully test every item. We offer a \"cursory\" inspection on all items and list our findings in the auction description. We supply all available Make/Model information for you to review and research. Please do your own research prior to bidding. All items and contents are described to the best of our ability. Unless the auction description states differently, these items are sold and \"as-is\". We reserve the right to refuse sale or service for any reason. WHEN SHOULD I SEND PAYMENT? Payment is due within 10 days of the closing of the auction. Otherwise, we reserve the right to re-post or re-sell this item and request credit from eBay, at our discretion. Acceptable forms of payment include Cashier Checks, Money Orders, and Bank Wire Transfers. If necessary, we can accept personal or company checks. We normally ship within 3-5 business days for certified funds. We hold all checks for 7-10 working days for validation. We do not use I-Escrow or any other escrow company. Other payment terms may be available and will be disclosed in our \"Payment Email\" that will be sent to you at the end of the auction. Unless otherwise stated, Sales are final. All others we offer a 50% restocking fee for any returns, less shipping and paypal fees (if applicable). I WON MORE THAN ONE ITEM OR I AM BIDDING ON MORE OF YOUR AUCTIONS. SHOULD I WAIT AND SEND PAYMENTS ALL AT ONCE? I MAY SAVE A BUCK OR TWO? Although we appreciate you bidding on more of our items, it would be more efficient if you sent in each payment as the item closes. We use an automated system and it sends out confirmations, feedbacks, Non-Pay Bidder Reminders, and other eBay related operations automatically. That's why it's so important to get payment in within 10 days of the close of the auction and keep auctions as separate transactions. If you delay, you may get warnings from eBay or you may actually lose your item because it got re-posted. We also do not combine shipping fees because we ship from various warehouses and cannot guarantee that items will be shipped together. Also, it requires us to manually do each multiple order and that interferes with our automated system. Therfore, we do not combine shipping fees. If you get multiple items shipped together, it's just a matter of luck and chance. HOW DO YOU SHIP WITH AND WHAT IF I'M OUTSIDE YOUR STANDARD SHIPPING AREA? We ship via UPS Ground from Connecticut, 06804. For books, videos, CDs video games and other media we may offer Media Mail Rates. If available, it would be listed in the auction description. We cannot ship to PO BOXES or Military APO addresses. If you are outside the 48 contiguous US states, shipping fees are more. Please contact us for the estimated rates prior to bidding. PAYPAL USERS: We can ONLY ship to verified Paypal addresses. If you want it shipped to a different address send your payment via the mail. Whenever possible, we will provide shipping weights and/or fixed shipping costs. Fixed shipping rates are for shipping within the 48 contiguous states. If you are outside of this area, contact us prior to bidding. Shipping will be higher. Sorry, we do not combine shipping fees. It screws up our automated accounting and shipping programs. HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN YOU RECEIVE MY PAYMENT OR WHEN MY ITEM IS SHIPPED? We issue the buyer a Positive Feedback the day your payment is received and entered. You can use this as a reference of when your item will be shipped. If you provide us an email, we will email you a tracking number. All shipping questions should be directed to shipping@highendequipment.com. We are no longer responsible for items once it is picked up by the courier. If damage occurs during transit, we will assist in the claims process. No product refunds will be issued until the claim is paid. Shipping fees are not refundable for any reason. ANYTHING ELSE BEFORE I BID? Please read all the information on the auction and do your research prior to bidding. If you have any questions, please call our office at 203-740-9111 or email us at inquiry@highendequipment.com. By placing a bid on this auction you are confirming that you have read all the information, asked all your questions, and understand the terms of this auction. NICE FEEDBACK RATING, BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY NEGATIVES? The fact of the matter is, we are only human. We do make mistakes. We also use automated systems and internet based platforms to help automate the selling process. We can fix our human errors, unfortunately the others are not as easy. We can't fix external programs like eBay or AuctionWatch. Most problems can be resolved with one phone call. We try our best to service all customers and when we make a mistake, we take care of it. Not every buyer gives us the opportunity to correct for our mistakes. Most of our negatives are from new users who don't understand or respect the rules of eBay. They don't read the auctions and are not very good shoppers. If a problem comes up, they SLAM a Negative Feedback and not even give us a chance to address the issue. Basically, when we are given the opportunity, we take care of everybody. Hey, you can't be an eBay PowerSeller without doing something right! MAN, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS RETURN EMAILS FASTER? Everyone in our company travels frequently to find the best deals to bring to you on eBay. Therefore, it is difficult for us to return emails in a timely manner. If all else fails, call our office for assistance. 203-740-9111. Office hours are Mon-Fri 9am-5pm EST. We strive to bring you the best items at the very best prices possible!
