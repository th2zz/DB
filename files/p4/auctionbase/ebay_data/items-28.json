Fabric and leather should be solid, durable, and of the highest quality. An eBay description which says the bag has a Gucci label but fails to say it is authentic is a warning sign that it might be a counterfeit item. Whether or not you decide to buy here, beware of any auction or seller who cannot guarantee authenticity! The quality of the fakes is not nearly the same as the real thing. There are few fashion designers who have been as influential as Gucci. They have remained at the very top of the fashion world for decades, and consistently set the pace for the rest of the pack. This 100% authentic Gucci purse shows why many fashion aficionados are willing to spend a few week_s salary to own a Gucci item. It is made of jet black fabric subtly embossed with Gucci_s famous crossed _GG_ logo. It is trimmed and detailed with black leather, and has a single black leather strap in that in-between size that lets you choose between wearing it off your shoulder or carrying it as a tote. The roomy interior has a single internal zippered compartment, and the bag snaps sharply shut via an internal magnetic strap Absolutely fabulous! The bag measures 11.5\" inches accross the bottom tapering up to 9.5\" at the top. It stands 10\" tall, and the strap measures 22\" long including the hardware. _Gucci, Made in Italy_ is engraved in the handsome silver metal attachments which hold the strap, on the magnetic snap which closes the bag, and on the leather tag on the interior. There is a Gucci serial number under the tag. _Gucci_ is also embossed on the leather zipper pull which closes the internal compartment. This 100% authentic bag is direct from Saks Fifth Avenue, where it was used briefly as display model on a mannequin. It is in brand new condition and has never been worn. This fabulous bag retails for over $550. With a $10 starting bid and no reserve, this is a real steal that you don_t want to miss! Direct from Saks Fifth Avenue to you for a fraction of the cost! Each month I list dozens of shoes, bags and accessories that were used briefly as floor models or were returns to Saks Fifth Avenue. These items have little or no wear. They are all guaranteed authentic, and are all from the very top designers. Some still have the original Saks labels on them. Unless otherwise mentioned, they do not come with boxes or dust bags. None were originally priced lower than $150, some sell for more than $600. Most of my auctions will begin below $50 with NO RESERVE. I put up new items all the time, so check my auctions frequently, and most of all, HAVE FUN! MY TERMS: Domestic shipping/handling for this item will be $6.00. International shipping rates will vary. All purchases must be paid for in US dollars. I cannot accept returns on clothing or shoes. I am not responsible if a shoe does not fit. I list the brand and the size and it is your responsibility to know if you can wear this brand in this size. I am happy to provide any measurements you request before you bid. Misrepresented items will be accepted back if returned to me within ten days of receipt. Postal insurance is extra and mandatory on all domestic purchases over $50. If payment is not received within ten days, I reserve the right to cancel the transaction and relist the item.

This week I've got a few examples of these models. This auction is for a Shift Kicker 'Cookin' Capri'. This one is mint in it's original package. It's based on an early 80s Mercury Capri. It was made in Hong Kong. There is a stick shift sticking out the rear window. As it says on the package 'Rev it up! Pop it in gear! Watch it peel out!' An interesting addition to your collection from around 1982/83. Die-cast metal with rubber Goodyear racing tires, it measures about 3 inches long. Please see the photo above. I'll be glad to answer any E-questions you have but please get them in early as I am not always online as the auctions are ending. The lucky bidder agrees to pay within 10 days and to include $3.50 for Priority Post. I will contact you within 24 hours after the auctions close, please ignore any references to Checkout inserted by Ebay. There are no additional shipping and handling charges. Insurance is optional but recommended, the reponsibility is up to you. Foreign bidders that can use Bid-Pay or Pay-Pal are invited. Everything else is just taking way too long . Foreign shipments can go by either uninsured regular Air Mail or insured Global Express, we'll discuss the actual charges once I know where it is going. Accepted payments are by US$ Money Orders, BID-PAY or PAY-PAL. All assure next day shipping. Please check out my other auctions for more interesting Hot Wheel diecasts.

I'm assuming the width is EE because they are a little too loose for me. The numbers printed inside the boots are 105 3 378. There is a label inside the shafts that say \"LA # 1 Billy Boots\". The shafts have 4 rows of subtle stitching. The bull-doggin' heels are 2 inches high and have \"Billy Boots-Handmade\" imprinted on their bottoms. The toes are pointed with the soles squared at the tips, there is a stitched \"toe-bug\" on the tops. The soles and heels are in like new condition, looks like they were worn maybe 4 times. The boot is all leather, except for the lining of the foot, which is a fleece/flannel material; because of this, I think this would make a GREAT boot for the Winter months. There are a few minor cosmetic problems with these boots: Firstly, there are a few minor cracks in the piping that goes up the sides of the boots-nothing that a black marker wouldn't fix. Secondly, there is a minor stain above the heel area on the right boot-NOT driver rub, the leather on these is in good condition. Overall, a really HOT looking pair of winter kickers.

PLEASE READ: If you love high-fashioned heels, then do I have the auctions for you . Over the next few weeks I will be parting with most of my gorgeous high-heel collection. I presently have over 500 pair of the most gorgeous high-heeled shoes that can be found anywhere. You see during the 80_s and early 90_s I was a sought after model and performer, and if I saw a style of shoe that I really liked, I would buy 1 in every color made. So many of the shoes will be available in m a n y c o l o r s . My foot had gotten a little larger as a progressed through my 20_s so many shoes will be size from size 8 to 9.5 (most being 8.5 and 9_s).Most were NEVER EVEN WORN? Brand Names include \"W*ld Pair\", \"Pr*xy\", \"9-W*st\",\"C*ndies\",\"S*cha London\", \"Pr*vate Collection\", \"Sp*nish Leather\", \"P*lizzio\", \"J*zz\", \"Pr*via\", \"All*re\", \"K*rin Morgan\" ,\"M*inframe\", \"C*lvin Klein\", \"SR*\", \"Ch*ndlers\",\"Fr*dericks of Hollyw**d\", \"Car*ssa\", \"Sergi* V*lente\", \"B*re Traps\", \"Vict*ria_s S*cret\", \"Z*diak\", \"Ann* Kl*in II\" and many others. It breaks my heart to part with these lovely shoes. But they don_t fit me now, and I don_t foresee my foot getting any smaller in the future. ( thanks to my lovely 17 year old foot models Lisa T (cassidy), Michelle (roche), and Sarah (the princess) who without their help would never have gotten these all on Ebay) Please watch all my auctions over the next several weeks (click on \" view seller_s other auctions \") under my Ebay ID at the top of this page. I pulled some of the shoes that were either \"Extreme\" or \"Holiday Fashion\" so that they could be bought in time for the Holidays. After that I will auction my \"Fall/Winter\" collection and finally my \"Spring/Summer\" (watch for my collection of C*ndies vintage slides in about 8 different colors) Some of the auctions will show several shoes (same style/different colors)- winning bidder will get to choose their color- If they want MORE than 1 color or ALL the colors, please let me know at auction end so that we make work out a special price for additional color(s). I want you to be COMPLETELY satisfied with your purchase. I have FLAWLESS FEEDBACK and am determined to keep it that way. I want repeat and multiple purchase customers. I will work with you on additional pairs for price/shipping. I am not interested in gouging you on add_l shipping _ If I can fit them in the box and it doesn_t cost ME anymore- It won_t cost YOU anymore.

I think it says IPICANO Material: Cotton Condition: Mint - no problems This black and white shirt was in a lot of items I bought and everyone who has seen it has said, \"don't auction that - nobody will want that thing.\" I have to say, it is an odd shirt, but that's what makes it unique and one of a kind. I called it a \"hands\" shirt because that was a first impression - it's like hands with lots of fingers draped over your shoulders. They are covered with silver sequins. The sleeves are quilted so stand out like that over your shoulders. The material feels like a cotton twill, a good sturdy material, not thin at all. This one could be dressy or casual. The one thing it will always be is a conversation starter!! MEASUREMENTS 38\" Bust and body 25\" Long from the top of the shoulders Measurements are actual, with no stretching. When measuring I lay them flat, measure the width of each location and double. The bust is measured approximately 1/2\" beneath the armpit seam. The waist is measured at the narrowest place on the garments. The hips are measured at 10\" below the waist. Buyer to pay $3.00 shipping USA. International figured separately. Insurance and/or delivery confirmation extra if desired. Money order, cash or personal check, PayPal, or BidPay accepted. I am always glad to combine shipping on multiple wins within a reasonable length of time. Please note that colors can appear differently on different monitors. If there is any question about colors please ask before bidding. My low opening bid in no way reflects on the quality. Consider me your own PERSONAL SHOPPER. I love to go shopping and find bargains to pass along to you. Some things are new; some of them are used. But all of them are things I'd be happy to own myself. I often start the bidding below $10.00 to save on Ebay's listing fees and to give you the opportunity to enjoy being part of the bidding. I carefully inspect my items and note any flaws in the ad description. I clearly state how and where the measurements are taken. No refunds unless I have grossly misrepresented the item. If you have any questions, please write and ask. SEWCAKES@AOL.COM PLEASE DO NOT BID ON MY AUCTIONS IF YOU CANNOT PAY within 14 days after receipt of my confirmation letter at close of auction. If payment is not received by the 14th day, or we have not made other arrangements, I will file a non-pay bidder alert with Ebay, cancel the deal, leave negative feedback and relist the item. THANKS FOR LOOKING AT MY AUCTIONS I mostly sell new and vintage formal dresses and gowns that are suitable for a variety of wearers and events such as cruise, reunion, anniversary, pageant, prom or any special occasion where you may need something fancy to wear.
