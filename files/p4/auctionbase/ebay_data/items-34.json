HOLIDAY SHIPPING OPTIONS FOR THE USA We ship almost everything using the US Post Office. If the shipping charge stated is less than $3.50, the item is shipped via first class mail which is normally 2 to 4 days to anywhere in the USA. There is no delivery confirmation available on this and packages in rare instances have taken up to two weeks to arrive (way less than 1% of the time). Past history in shipping tells us that the Post Office actually does a very good job in December, yet with the volume of mail they process, packages do sometimes get misrouted. All items with a stated shipping charge of $3.50 or more are already shipped via priority mail, most with a delivery confirmation. Priority mail shipping with a delivery confirmation number sent to you is available on any item we sell where the shipping charge is stated at under $3.50. The cost for this is $4 and applies to the ties and most of the small ornaments that we are selling. If you want this service just submit $4 in place of any lower shipping amount stated and we will ship priority mail. Express mail overnight shipping is also available at a cost of $13.00 up to 8 ounces (single ties), 8 ounces to 2 pounds at $17 (most plates) and 2 to 3 pounds, $20. This is guaranteed overnight to most of the USA but may take two days to more rural areas.

They were also designed to be compatible with the British company Halcyon\"s 1/35 APC kit released at the same time. Also, most of the kits featured extra sets of arms, legs, heads and torso parts to allow the figures to be posed in several different ways during assembly. This kit of Ferro features two heads (one with sunglasses and one without), two sets of arms and legs, flight helmut, clipboard, hand gun (in and out of holster), an 11-piece dropship seat, and base. Ferro can be posed standing or sitting. Instructions feature a painting guide and personnel report on Ferro. Comes in a resealable ziploc bag with header card, which has been opened by me.

AEF\"s 1/35 resin Aliens line from the late 80\"s/early 90\"s was probably the most extensive US model kit line based on a science fiction film, EVER, kitting nearly every character, and nearly every *situation*, from that film! They were also designed to be compatible with the British company Halcyon\"s 1/35 APC kit released at the same time. This kit features Newt\"s family members - father Russ, mother Ann, and brother Timmy - from the \"Derelict Discovery\" scene that was cut for theatrical release and later restored for laserdisc and DVD. Included are a sitting Timmy with tractor seat, and standing Ann and Russ with what may be flashlights, one alien egg (closed), and two bases. There are no instructions. One reason for this may be because this set was issued near the end of AEF\"s license and they may simply not had time. Comes in a resealable ziploc bag with header card, which has been opened by me.

In the study, the 122 moderately overweight individuals who took chromium picolinate lost an average of 6.2 pounds of body fat as opposed to only 3.4 pounds in those individuals in the placebo group. \"The data clearly confirm that supplementation with chromium picolinate can lead to significant improvements in body composition resulting from fat loss, particularly for individuals who may not be as aggressive in making lifestyle changes such as reducing caloric intake or increasing their physical activity.\" Gilbert Kaats, PhD, of the Health and Medical Research Foundation in San Antonio and lead investigator in the study. 100% Pure Pharmaceutical Grade Calcium Pyruvate 160mg : Calcium Pyruvate 160 mg : Pyruvate plays a crucial role in this conversion of food to energy. Pyruvate increases cellular respiration, or the amount of energy the mitochondria (the cells' metabolic furnace) use. The more energy used, the less the body stores. Ronald T. Stanko, M.D., at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, conducted a study involving 14 obese women (average weight 256 pounds), who were fed a 1,000-calorie liquid diet for three weeks. Those taking pyruvate lost 37% more weight (13 versus 9.5 pounds) and 48% more fat (8.8 versus 5.9 pounds) than the control group. 100% Pure Pharmaceutical Korean Ginseng Complex 125mg Korean Ginseng Complex 125mg : Ginseng is a popular antioxidant herb used to i ncrease energy , strengthen the immune system and to protect the body against the physical effects of stress and fatigue. Compounds found in ginseng help to combat harmful viruses and bacteria and certain cancers. The herb also has positive effects on the nervous system and one of its substances, panaxans, lowers blood sugar levels. Studies have shown that Ginseng is also a good appetitie suppressant. 100% Pure Pharmaceutical Nutritional & MetaBolism Booster Complex : 200mg MetaboUltra-Max - Thermogenic & Lipotropic Metabolism Booster 30 SOFTGELS PER BOTTLE - PRODUCT DOSAGE: Take 1 SoftGel Daily - Preferably 30 minutes before lunch with a large glass of water.

This fabulous coat is made from genuine top quality lether and fox fur. The color is very unique, it is sort of like limegreen or darker citrus green, a very eye catching color. The pics show a bit of yellowish, and the actual item does not have that color. Also the texture of the fur is absolutely fab, it is not rabbit fur texture which is frangile and can fall off with wear. The fur collar and hand cuffs on this jacket are absolutely steady and well made. THEY ARE DETACHABLE too with hooks to be easily buttoned to the coat or other outfit of your choice. Coat has 6 huge size buttons lined with rhinestones. 2 side pockets and 1 inner pocket. Coat and fur collar/hand cuffs are fully lined. This is a truly stunning leather coat with class and timeless elegance!

Option 3: Other private carriers, such as UPS/FedEx/DHL might have faster delivery service, such as next day delivery or 2 days delivery, but sometimes we find that the services provided by these carriers might not be that reliable since we had buyers who told us they left the packages by the door and packages had been lost without compensation.

I will be more than happy to provide you with additional pictures, close-ups of fabric, and measurements. I want you to be confident that you are bidding on an item that you really want and like. New Condition, tags are still on item. Minimum bid will be slightly higher than most others on my auctions. Great Condition, items has been worn once or twice. No stains or tears. Good Condition, item has been worn several times. Should be considered gently worn and there may be some stains or tears. Terms of the Auction: All items have been previously owned and worn. Before shipping, I have either dry-cleaned or laundered your purchase. I do use fabric softener so let me know if you would like me to prepare your item in a special way. All items also come from a smoke and pet free home. All known imperfections have been listed above. Please contact me for further information on a particular item. I will be more than happy to provide you with detailed pictures. Please use common sense when bidding. Do not overbid on an item and then expect a return or expect to pull out because you are \"disappointed\". You are not going to find real gemstones under the heading for costume jewelry. You are not going to find new condition upscale brand name items selling for $2.00. Return Policy: All sales should be considered final. If you are unclear on the concept of bidding on an item at auction please ask questions first. This experience is very different from going to the mall and making a purchase. There are always extenuating circumstances. If you sincerely believe this applies to you contact me and we will work to resolve the issue. This does not mean that you will be granted a refund. If you receive an item and it \"isn't what you expected\", too bad. I make every effort to make sure that all information on an item is provided. If you aren't sure, then ask questions. If you still aren't sure then don't bid. Sorry to have to be tough on this but there too many people bidding who aren't serious about buying.

ABOUT US The both of us being compulsive shoppers, we have travelled the world buying all sorts of goodies! From clothing to antiques to collectibles - we buy it all! Problem is, we live in a condo and so we have to rotate out items to make room for new items! As far as the clothing, the great majority of them were bought AT the retailer or from the retailer at FULL PRICE. I will resell items that I have purchased from other great sellers that did not fit us or fullfill our own needs. I have a bad habit of buying things without trying them on or on a whim and being too lazy to return it if it doesn't work out. We also bring you fashions from ALL OVER THE GLOBE. As frequent traveller's, many items come from London, Hamburg, Amsterdam, Paris, Bangkok, Tokyo, Mexico and India.....Seattle, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago & San Francisco! Many articles of clothing or accesories have been handmade expressly for me for quite a bit of money. We don't but cheap, poorly made items. For as many designer labels we have, we also have one of a kind items too!. As part-time musicians subject to a globally diverse group of people with different looks of style and fashion, we bring to you some of the hippest, UNIQUE items that you don't always see everywhere else! STAND OUT FROM THE REST OF THE CROWD! And if we're selling it, you should be sure it's passed our \"fashionably acceptable\" standards! We are not \"Power Seller's\" nor is this a \"business\". I doubt we are actually breaking even. Please keep that in mind. So check back frequently at other items I might be selling as we are CONSTANTLY having to rotate out things in the place! Good luck.

It is a really nice lighter grey (not metallic blue like the photos show).It is the grey shade that was popular in 70's leather jackets, which makes this jacket very stylish. I bought this off ebay a few months ago, but it did not really fit my chest. I loved this jacket so much that I contemplated getting a reduction! Anyways, this is my loss and your gain! I paid a lot for this!! It is a size 8 and it is 36\" across the chest,and it's 28\" long. It is a very sexy fit because it comes in at the waist to emphasize curves. The leather shows absolutely no wear. The lining is 100% acetate, which feels just like satin, and it is cream. BCBG is a great French label that are known for their sophisticated designs and superior quality. I have to say that I do not think you will ever come across a better deal than this one. I am sorry about the bad photos, they do not do this jacket justice. Please email me with any questions you have. There is still time to get this item for Christmas, so if you are a great friend/relative (or you want to buy yourself a deserving gift) than you have to pick this up! Thank you for looking and good luck!"}, {"ItemID": "1678192936", "Name": "PEARLS ~BROOCH~ WATCH", "Category": ["Jewelry, Gems & Watches", "Fine Jewelry", "New, Contemporary", "Pins, Brooches", "Other Materials"], "Currently": "$12.99", "Buy_Price": "$32.39", "First_Bid": "$12.99", "Number_of_Bids": "0", "Bids": null, "Location": "Brooklyn, NY", "Country": "USA", "Started": "Dec-15-01 01:20:13", "Ends": "Dec-20-01 01:20:13", "Seller": {"UserID": "killmesier", "Rating": "446"}, "Description": "GREAT GIFT IDEA!!!
