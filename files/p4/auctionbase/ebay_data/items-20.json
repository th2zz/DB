Meet Elliot Richards, a well-meaning but socially inept technical-support advisor who is in love with Alison Gardner, a female co-worker. Unfortunately she barely knows he's alive. Desperate to gain Alison's affections, Elliot strikes a deal with the Devil - a lusty, drop-dead gorgeous woman with, as he'll soon discover, a wicked sense of humor. In exchange for Elliot's soul, the temptress will grant him seven wishes. To start, Elliot asks to be rich, powerful and married to Alison. When he awakens the next morning, he discovers he's all that and more - as a Colombian drug lord. No problem, he thinks, because he's got six more wishes. How about becoming the most emotionally sensitive man in the world? Sure, only Elliot ends up a sniveling, driveling fool. A 7' 6\" basketball superstar? Elliot breaks all NBA records, but unfortunately his \"equipment\" doesn't measure up. Elliot is learning the hard way to be careful what he wishes for. Because the Devil, always a step ahead of him, is dishing up hilariously subversive versions of Elliot's desires, turning each of his new lives into a living hell. BEDAZZLED stars BRENDAN FRASER as Elliot Richards, a hapless young man consumed by unrequited love and desperate to change his life. ELIZABETH HURLEY plays the Devil, who slyly promises to do just that - for a price. FRANCES O'CONNOR plays Alison Gardner, the object of Elliot's affections. 6660024 This outfit is worn by Brendan as the drug lord when he desires to be \"rich\". Click here to view all FOX Auctions.

In his quest to create a vampire film to die for, F.W. Murnau (Malkovich) hires the mysterious Max Schreck (Dafoe) to play Count Orlock in his masterpiece Nosferatu. Murnau introduces Schreck as \"the ultimate method actor\" -- one who will appear only in character, in full makeup and only at night. But as the cast and crew begin to disappear, it appears that Murnau has made a devil's bargain with Screck. With luminous performances and biting humor, Shadow of the Vampire holds you in its icy grip from start to finish. Rated R. Approximate running time: 93 minutes.

The James DeMonaco/Kevin Fox screenplay follows an accused man who is forced to commit crimes in order to prove himself innocent of murder. After Chicago police hostage negotiator Danny Roman (Samuel L. Jackson ) succeeds in rescuing a little girl menaced by her gun-wielding dad, he's praised by both the police department and the media, and he returns to his usual cop routines with his longtime partner, promising his new wife Karen (Regina Taylor ) he'll make it home for dinner every night. Then his partner, who had evidence of embezzlement within the police department, is killed. Since Danny arrives at the crime scene only seconds later, he's the main suspect, and Chief Al Travis (John Spencer ) asks him to turn in his gun and badge. Danny invades the Chicago Internal Affairs Division headquarters and tries to get the truth from Inspector Terence Niebaum (J.T. Walsh) while holding two assistants and Commander Frost (Ron Rifkin) as hostages. He then calls for an outsider from another precinct, hostage negotiator Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey ). When Sabian arrives, the two compete for control, while Danny attempts to prove to him that he's been falsely accused. The film is dedicated to J.T. Walsh, who died not long after the production wrapped. ~ Bhob Stewart, All Movie Guide I love Harry Potter Matrix Star Trek cell hobbit lord of the rings star wars"}, {"ItemID": "1497508770", "Name": "DISNEY'S Beauty and the Beast VHS", "Category": ["Movies & Television", "Video, Film", "VHS", "Children, Family"], "Currently": "$9.99", "First_Bid": "$9.99", "Number_of_Bids": "0", "Bids": null, "Location": "1000 Isands, Ontario", "Country": "Canada", "Started": "Dec-16-01 15:02:24", "Ends": "Dec-21-01 15:02:24", "Seller": {"UserID": "cdvideo1bid", "Rating": "3902"}, "Description": ".titledata { font-family: verdana, sans-serif; font-size:17px; color:#00000; font-weight : bold; } .description { font-family: verdana, sans-serif; color:#636145; background-color : #ffffff; } .link { font-family: verdana, sans-serif; font-size:12px; underline; } HR { color: #000000; } _ _ _ DISNEY'S Beauty and the Beast VHS _ _ _ _ Click image to view larger version THIS IS THE ORIGINAL WALT DISNEY CLASSIC OF THE FILM \"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST\".

Jack Willis, truck driver, who has just become a top selling romantic novelist.

Like two fish out of water and out of their depths, Jack and Ruby are drawn closer together as they cope with all the media attention and the big city life.

SYNOPSIS: In this science fiction thriller, child psychiatrist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) has developed a technique that allows her to travel through the minds of her patients. When Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio ), a multiple murder who methodically drowns his victims and performs bizarre rituals with their bodies, falls into a coma, FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) asks Deane to enter the killer's psyche, in the hope of finding a missing girl whom Stargher has kidnapped; if she's not soon found, in all likelihood she'll die in his torture cell. However, once Deane enters the bizarre world of Stargher's mind, she finds getting out to be a very difficult matter. The Cell was the first feature from director Tarsem, who previously made award-winning commercials and music videos, including the video for R.E.M.'s \"Losing My Religion.\" The supporting cast includes Catherine Sutherland, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Dylan Baker, and Pruitt Taylor Vance. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide I love Harry Potter Matrix Star Trek cell hobbit lord of the rings star wars"}, {"ItemID": "1497521550", "Name": "THE PERFECT STORM DVD like new condition!", "Category": ["Movies & Television", "Video, Film", "DVD", "Action, Adventure"], "Currently": "$5.00", "First_Bid": "$5.00", "Number_of_Bids": "0", "Bids": null, "Location": "Charleston, SC", "Country": "USA", "Started": "Dec-16-01 15:46:59", "Ends": "Dec-23-01 15:46:59", "Seller": {"UserID": "jaerter", "Rating": "44"}, "Description": "BEING JOHN MALKOVICH THE PERFECT STORM On DVD Own this film on DVD.

Posters from the WPA [Work Projects Administration, originally known as Works Progress Administration] were originally produced from 1936 to 1943 as part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal program to put Americans back to work. The objective of the posters were to promote and publicize many programs from 17 different states and the District of Columbia including: education, community activities, culture, health and safety, travel and tourism, and World War II. Federal Project Number One was established within the WPA as central administration for arts related projects. This was one of the first government programs to support the arts and allowed funding for the Federal Arts Project (FAP) which employeed thousands of artists. Many of these artists worked on WPA poster divisions throughout the US. The diverse poster divisions and the interactions on the many artists associated with them helped to create what is now known as the American poster style. LEARN MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE WPA PROGRAM.

Stars: Bette Davis, Donald Crisp, Fay Bainter, George Brent, Georgia Caine, Gordon Oliver, Henry Fonda, Henry O'Neill, Irving Pichel, Jack Norton, Janet Shaw, John Litel, Margaret Lindsay, Richard Cromwell, Spring Byington. Set in the antebellum South, William Wyler_s JEZEBEL centers on high society beauty Julie Marsden. Julie first arrives on horseback, then enters her home flamboyantly hooking the long flowing train of her dress with her riding crop and hoisting it to her shoulders. Julie is not just high-spirited--she is self-centered and high-handed, and she gets away with outrageous behavior because she is rich and beautiful. However, she gets her comeuppance--losing Pres and becoming reclusive and spiteful--before a chance for redemption occurs. JEZEBEL is built around Bette Davis_s bold, powerful, and, at times, subtle performance; when Julie discovers Pres and Amy are married, with the smallest of movements Davis conveys disbelief, then anguish as she realizes the truth--she looks down, her eyelids flicker, she glances from Pres to Amy and back, and utters single words while struggling to maintain her composure. And Fay Bainter, as Aunt Belle, matches Davis when she too discovers Pres is married and continues to greet her guests while worrying about her niece and how she can warn her. Both actresses won well-deserved Oscars. JEZEBEL is also distinguished by Wyler_s and cinematographer Ernest Haller_s graceful, flowing long takes and deep-frame compositions.

I have a number of different celebrities on these coins. You may want to try to collect all of them. Only .75 cents to ship in the U.S. I have a number of related items up for sale on eBay. If you would like to see them click here. Bob Hope (Leslie Townes Hope) actor, comedian Born: 5/29/03 Birthplace: Eltham, England American film, radio and television comedian known for his topical jokes, quick delivery and long career in show business. He appeared in several Road films with comedy partner Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour. His films include Road to Utopia (1940) and The Paleface (1947). Since 1940, Hope has tirelessly entertained U.S. troops stationed overseas. For those of you who don t know, Mardi Gras doubloons are brightly colored aluminum coins about the size of a silver dollar. They are thrown by Krewe members from Mardi Gras floats. Doubloons usually have the symbol of the Krewe on the front along with the date the Krewe was organized, the back side usually has the theme for that years parade as well as the date. Each Krewe may have a number of different doubloons for each years parade. Usually the silver ones are the most common, followed by a range of colors from red to gold. Some Krewes mint real bronze, silver and even gold doubloons, however these are very rare and seldom put up for sale. Many Mardi Gras doubloons are fairly rare outside of New Orleans, and many are rare even in the city. They make great inexpensive yet unique collectibles or gifts. I am in the process of auctioning a number of doubloons from my collection. The subject matter of my individual doubloon auctions vary a great deal. I have coins for a lot of different themes.

Isaac, the boy preacher, told them that He Who Walks Behind the Rows was pleased, and three years later the children still follow Isaac and his evil teenage disciple, Malachai. When a young couple traveling cross-country accidentally drive into Gatlin, they begin to discover the town's terrible secrets. However, what they don't realize is that they have become part of the children's bloody mission; a mission that cannot be fulfilled until the two intruders are dead.

This is a film full of atmosphere - wonderful cinematography, beautiful locations, a stunning soundtrack and some fantastic performances. Don't look at this film and think this is a war film, it isn't, this is film about East meets West, Clashes of tradition, culture and beliefs.

If such a thing as mood music exists then this is mood film - switch the lights off, turn the sound up and be absorbed. Visually stunning, fantastic soundtrack, outstanding performances all around.

MINT!!! 5 Oscar Nominations!! Stars Johnny Depp, Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina and Lena Olin. Edition Details: _ Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only) _ Color, Closed-captioned, Widescreen, Dolby _ Commentary by director Lasse Hallstrom and the producers _ Production Design Featurette _ Making Of Chocolat _ Deleted Scenes _ A feature on the film's costumes _ Widescreen anamorphic format With movies like Chocolat, it's always best to relax and absorb the abundant sensual pleasures, be it the heart-stopping smile of chocolatier Juliette Binoche as she greets a new customer, an intoxicating cup of spiced hot cocoa, or the soothing guitar of an Irish gypsy played by Johnny Depp. Adapted by Robert Nelson Jacobs from Joanne Harris's popular novel and lovingly directed by Lasse Hallstr_m, the film covers familiar territory and deals in broad metaphors that even a child could comprehend, so it's no surprise that some critics panned it with killjoy fervor. Their objections miss the point. Familiarity can be comforting and so can easy metaphors when placed in a fable that's as warmly inviting as this one. Driven by fate, Vianne (Binoche) drifts into a tranquil French village with her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol, from Ponette) in the winter of 1959. Her newly opened chocolatier is a source of attraction and fear, since Vianne's ability to revive the villagers' passions threatens to disrupt their repressive traditions. The pious mayor (Alfred Molina) sees Vianne as the enemy, and his war against her peaks with the arrival of \"river rats\" led by Roux (Depp), whose attraction to Vianne is immediate and reciprocal. Splendid subplots involve a battered wife (Lena Olin), a village elder (Judi Dench), and her estranged daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss), and while the film's broader strokes may be regrettable (if not for Molina's rich performance, the mayor would be a caricature), its subtleties are often sublime. Chocolat reminds you of life's simple pleasures and invites you to enjoy them.

SMITH & MR. JONES DVD NEW Description In the 1950s a super-secret government agency was formed to monitor and police the activities of extraterrestrial aliens on the planet Earth. Some 40 years later a founding father of the agency, Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones), finds himself with a new smart-mouthed partner fresh from the NYPD who is soon dubbed Agent Jay (Will Smith). Their first mission is to save the Earth from destruction by a giant insectlike alien (Vincent D_Onfrio) that, incidentally, drives an exterminator_s truck. Armed with their matching Ray-Bans, skinny ties, and space-age weapons that Jay barely understands--he calls the Neuralyzer the \"flashy thing\"--the new duo begin another average day of fighting intergalactic terrorists. An amazingly hip and terribly clever movie that riffs on everything from E.T.--THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL to CASABLANCA, this Barry Sonnenfeld film is based on the equally savvy comic book by Lowell Cunningham.

About racial tension at a California college, the characters are hopelessly stereotyped and grouped according to race, with the black guys being cool, the white guys being racists and rapists or, at the very least, slobs, and the women being prizes to be earned, even if the heroes win the sensitive, smart ones. Singleton made a name for himself coming out of college with a film script that landed him his first director's job, but it is hard to believe, watching the film, that he ever visited a campus. He turns the stimulating diversity of a university student body into a clich_d Balkanization of race and depicts professors ejecting students from classes for not paying their tuition on time. Many scenes in the 126 minute movie also go on for too long, and there is one very young actor playing a white racist who seems to be trying to imitate Marlon Brando in Roots II . That said, however, the film has a number of strikingly designed sequences, and in its exploration of racial and economic polarities it takes the time to present intelligent arguments--honest-to-goodness messages--about the necessity of working to the best of one's capabilities and not giving up in the face of despair. There is one especially memorable romantic sequence, an intercutting of two scenes, where one of the heroines is seen embracing a male lover in some shots and a female lover in others, edited in such a way that the gender of the woman's partner becomes irrelevant to the eroticism. Laurence Fishburne is also on hand as a political science teacher, and he handles what could be a very embarrassing role with great finesse, delivering Singleton's morals without batting an eyelash. Singleton depicts college as a place where the abstract intellectualism of learning grinds against life's realities, searching for an even sprocket. He manages to find a few, not enough to prevent the movie from failing, but enough to make the failure worthwhile. The picture is letterboxed with an aspect ratio of about 1.85:1 and the framing looks accurate. The color transfer is fine. Fleshtones are a little soft at times, but the image is solid and darker scenes are stable. The stereo surround sound is good, and the music soundtrack is appropriately boisterous. The program is effectively closed captioned. The film is spread to three sides in CLV and is accompanied by a promising theatrical trailer A film by John Singleton.

Gorgeous 8 X 10 color glossy photo of actress BARBARA EDEN. An Arizona native, actress Barbara Eden was three years old when her family moved to San Francisco, where as a teenager she plunged into acting and singing classes at San Francisco State College's Conservatory of Music. After briefly working as a band singer, Eden took up residence at Hollywood's Studio Club, an inexpensive rooming house for aspiring actresses. Other Studio Club residents would note in later years that Eden would look at the club's bulletin board and apply for every show business job available, even those that she was advised would \"ruin\" her career. Persistence paid off, and in 1956 Eden made her film debut in Back from Eternity. She worked steadily in television, finally attaining leading-lady status on the 1958 sitcom How to Marry a Millionaire, in which she played a myopic \"Marilyn Monroe\"-type golddigger. Good film and TV roles followed for the lovely blonde actress, and full stardom arrived with the NBC comedy series I Dream of Jeannie. Eden played the curvaceous bottle imp from 1965-70, reviving the character in a brace of TV movies, the last one produced in 1991. Eden's post-Jeannie career has included several films, TV guest star appearances, theatrical and nightclub engagements, and still another sitcom, 1981's Harper Valley P.T.A. _ Hal Erickson PLEASE READ: I do not utilize at this time the optional \"checking out\" feature displayed on my item description page by EBAY.

But though Hard Core Logo can be cuttingly funny, it's not really a comedy; it's a piercing examination of friendship and betrayal, success and self-hatred, and everything that fueled punk rock. Lead singer Joe Dick (Hugh Dillon) uses false pretenses to convince guitarist Billy Tallent (Callum Keith Rennie) to reform Hard Core Logo for a reunion tour across Canada, followed by a film crew (featuring director Bruce McDonald, whose other films include Roadkill and Highway 61, as himself). Tallent agrees, but only because he expects to be joining a much more successful rock group very shortly and sees this as a favor to Dick. As they travel from town to town, their relationship unravels, as does the psyche of bass player John Oxenberger (John Pyper-Ferguson). The performances are astonishingly genuine; even the oafish drummer Pipefitter (Bernie Coulson) becomes three-dimensional. By the end, you'll believe in them so much as people that the band's disintegration is truly wrenching. A remarkable film, both comic and sad.

I run up to 400 items per week and by splitting up my items I will be better able to serve you. You will receive your items quicker by allowing me to split the work of processing orders among my partners. Theses preprints are among the best quality I have ever seen and are exact replicas of the original Hand Signed Versions that I have in my display cases covering the walls of my home and office space. Many of these original photos are worth over $100.00 and here you can have an exact replica for a fraction of the cost. I promise 99.9% of the people who receive these photos have a very very very hard time telling the difference from the original hand signed one. These things are so damn good that even I can barely tell the difference from the originals when they are both in my hand, and when they are hanging onm the wall in a picture frame it is virtually impossible. These replicas are wonderful for bars, restaurants, club houses, ect where theft is a possibility. Customers will think they are real and it one gets stolen or damaged it not like your out hundreds of dollars. Shipping is $2.00 no matter how many you buy!!! $5.00 outside USA.

His student, Yen Lo, has turned to the dark side and been \"killed\" by the Master's daughter, but is managing to stay alive by hiding out in limbo.

I obtained this piece in Toronto in August 1996. I have over 9 years of experience in obtaining in-person autographs and can quote where and when each one of my items was signed. In-person means that the person that is selling the item witnessed it been signed and can give you an exact location and date as to where the item was signed and even in many instances provide you with some sort of photographic evidence of the meeting. With this said please be extremely cautious when bidding on any autographed items on eBay. Ask the seller where and when the item was signed and who witnessed it being signed. In a recent investigation conducted by the FBI, Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Attorney_s Office code-named \"Operation Bullpen\" released in April 2000 it stated: \"The sports and celebrity memorabilia market in the United States is approximately one billion dollars per year. Industry experts estimate that upwards of 50% (and perhaps as much as 90%) of the items comprising this market are counterfeit.\" The report went on to say: \"If the price is too good to be true, it is probably a fake\". This means that potential bidders should question the authenticity of all high-end items that are up on eBay for ridiculously low market prices. From my experience I know that celebrity, musical and sports related autographs are not easy to obtain and when I obtain them it is in extreme limited quantities; hence they command high selling prices to reflect and compensate for the difficulty in obtaining these signatures. Should you have any questions regarding this auction or with regards to authenticity in general please do not hesitate to send us your questions at: jponte@netzero.net. Note: Shipping for this item is $5 anywhere in North America and varies abroad.

When Havers mentions that he's thinking about blowing the whistle on the sordid goings-on, Caine, convinced that whatever the CIA is doing is for the greatest good, implores his son to keep quiet. Soon afterward, Havers is found murdered. Even after this, Caine refuses to think ill of his government and its allies. It takes the death of investigative reporter James Fox to shake Caine out of his self-denial and to confront the persons responsible for the killings within the GCH. The venerable John Gielgud offers a surprising characterization in this complex conspiracy thriller.

The film was masterfully directed by CLAIRE DENIS, who has directed several terrifc films including \"Nenette et Boni\", and \"Contre L'Oubli\". Based loosely on Herman Melville's novella, \"Billy Budd\", this film tells the story of an ex-Foreign Legion officer, Galoup, as he recalls his once glorious life, leading troops in the Gulf of Djibouti. His existence there was happy, strict and regimented, but the arrival of a promising young recruit, Sentain, plants the seeds of jealousy in Galoup's mind. Galoup feels compelled to rid the troop of Sentain, especially after Sentain becomes the object of affection of the High Commandant, who Galoup greatly admires. Ultimately, Galoup's jealousy leads to the destruction of both Sentain and himself. This film is worth seeing just for the final scene in which the reserved Galoup gets spastic! This video is in the French language with English subtitles. The video was once a rental but it is in excellent condition. It comes in its original box and there is a rental sticker affixed to the videotape. The video is in the NTSC format so it will play in all North American VCRs. Synopsis: This simmering drama is an exploration of moral and social values. Filled with implied eroticism, it's a rumination on the bitter predicament of a man stewing in petty jealousy that turns to murderous hate. It's a beautiful film to watch as it captures the drills and training regimens of shirtless, muscular young men as forms of dance. The focus is on a troubled sergeant, Galoup (Denis Lavant), and his irrational dislike for a raw recruit, Gilles Sentain (Gregoire Colin), whom he sees as an untrustworthy misfit. For his part, Sentain is entirely dutiful. But the sergeant is poised to destroy him in a classic struggle of good and evil. The film's vision of military men devoted to meaningless tasks, and constantly preparing for combat with an unseen enemy, is haunting, as is the resentment of the sergeant cast out from the tight community of the lesser ranked. His commander is Bruno Forestier (Michel Subor), a brooding careerist who has lost all sense of military purpose.

To Commemorate his part in this Cult Classic Peter Issued a VERY LIMITED Edition (Tag Bears his Name) of the Leather Jacket he wore for his role. IT IS IDENTICAL!! AND IT IS INCREDIBLE!! I purchased this Jacket for a pretty hefty sum because I LOVE Captain America and although as a woman it was too long and too tight across the \"top\" that SOMEHOW I would \"grow\" into it and when I did I would walk down the street and everyone would know that I was CAPTAIN-TESSA AMERICA!!(That's like a French Countessa only American Style). Well it STILL does not fit me!! I just cannot let this SUPER HANDSOME JACKET hang in the Closet another minute when some CAPTAIN AMERICA would love to own it! It is made of BUTTER SOFT LEATHER. Jackets don't get any more Patriotic than this with the Black Leather Background, The Red Leather, Blue Leather,The White Leather.. and The Red White and Blue Flag on the Back!! It is a JACKET that you may never again see on Ebay! Leather Stripes in Red, White and Blue down the front side and a band of the same on the left arm. A LARGE Cloth American Flag on the back. Check out the NEAT Medallion on the Front! The measurements are: Length::: 21 Inches from the back collar to the hem. Shoulder::21 Inches between back arm seams. Chest THIS IS THE IMPORTANT ONE:: 22 1/2 Inches between armpit seam, across the front. I believe that makes it a Mans 44-46. Sleeves:: 24 1/2 Inches from shoulder seam to cuff. Zippered side Pockets, Sleeve Closures, Inside Pocket. It does and has everything you need!! CONDITION IS FLAWLESS!! Worn once or twice and the little flag on Peters Leather Name tag is slightly separated..NOT of ANY importance BUT I always mention the tiny details. I would be be embarrassed to tell you how much I paid for this Jacket so let's just say that my reserve of $350.00 is a BARGAIN!! A once in a lifetime chance to own the Captain America Leather Jacket AND guess what!! IT IS MADE IN AMERICA!! WOW!!

After twenty years during which ABBA left a permanent mark on the history of pop music, their international popularity shows little sign of diminishing.

The story behind the painting In the summer of 1888, Van Gogh interrupted his work on landscapes and portraits, and turned to make a few still lifes. These were the sunflowers which, more than any other of his paintings, have made him known throughout the world. They are often the only works with which Van Gogh is identified. Vincent mentioned the idea of painting sunflowers in a letter to his friend, the painter Emile Bernard, written in August: _I am thinking about hanging half a dozen paintings of sunflowers in my studio, a decoration in which unmixed or broken chromatic yellows will shine from various backgrounds, blue, from the palest Veronese to royal blue, framed with wooden slats painted orange. The same kind of effect as stained-glass windows in a gothic church._ The thought of Gauguin had a decisive influence on this too. Vincent wrote a letter to his brother Theo, saying that they were intended for Gauguin: _I am painting with the enthusiasm of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which will not surprise you, since what it is all about painting large sunflowers. A few days later Vincent reported: _ I am now working on the fourth painting of the sunflowers. This fourth one is a bouquet of fourteen flowers with quinces and lemons that I did much earlier. But because it is much larger, it is quite impressive, and I believe that this time it is painted with more simplicity than the quinces and the lemons._ There is no doubt that Vincent meant the painting we are discussing here.

These two shows were rebroadcast on cable, and trimmed down to the best moments. One episode is from the first season and one is from the second, so you get to see both openings. The producer was George Schlatter, who'd done very well with \"Laugh-In.\" The tape starts with an episode from the second season, which originally aired on Oct. 12, 1975. The guests are Anthony Newley and the Ike and Tina Turner Revue, and here are the highlights from this show: Cher sings \"There'll Be Some Changes Made\" in a glitter pantsuit Anthony Newley sings a number from the 1975 musical version of \"The Old Curiosity Shop\" Ike and Tina Turner do a really fast musical number called \"Baby, Get It On\" Cher and Tina perform the duet \"Country Side of Life\" while dressed in amazing feathered outfits Cher and Ike do a brief comedy routine There's a big musical number based on Neil Diamond's \"Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show\" which starts with Newley doing the song while dressed as Brother Love, then Cher and Tina come out in glitter ensembles to \"testify\" that they used to do the \"hoochie-coo,\" and there's a big finish with \"Resurrection Shuffle\" and \"Saved,\" done with a stageful of dancers. The second show on the tape is the special that kicked off the first season of the show. It first aired on Feb. 12, 1975. The guests were Bette Midler, Elton John, and Flip Wilson. The highlights include: Cher opens the show with \"Let Me Entertain You\" Elton John appears in an enormous hat and collar, both in silver lame, making him look like a blend of the witch from Snow White, Queen Elizabeth I, and a Keebler elf. He and Cher perform \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\" My favorite part of this show is Cher as Laverne Lashinsky at her high school reunion, where she meets Flip Wilson doing his Geraldine Jones routine. Laverne looks fabulous in her dangly ball earrings, leopard-skin print dress, and cat's eye glasses, while Geraldine has tastefully donned short white gloves a la Jackie Kennedy Cher performs \"All in Love Is Fair\" on a set decorated with asparagus ferns hanging in macrama hangers; Cher appears to be wearing matching macrame earrings Cher was not allowed to do the \"Vamps\" routine from the old Sonny and Cher show, so instead she and Bette do a \"Trashy Ladies\" medley, which included \"A Lady with a Touch of Trash,\" \"I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate,\" \"Lulu's Back in Town,\" \"True Blue Lou,\" \"Put the Blame on Mame,\" \"Minnie the Moocher,\" \"Sweet Georgia Brown,\" and other songs. Bette and Cher are dressed in garter belts, high heels, and feather boas, and they do lots of physical comedy and lots of high kicks. They top off the number by shaking the tassels on their derrieres. Cher does her \"Saturday Night\" skit, coming home from a date with a wolf, making herself a snack she can't eat because of the calories, and cuddling up to her electric blanket Elton and Cher perform \"Bennie and the Jets\" Flip, Bette, Cher, and Elton are hilarious in a rest home comedy skit, wearing old people makeup and padding Elton cracks Cher up so much she can't stop laughing The show closes with a medley done with a striped piano amid hundreds of pastel balloons, and Elton dressed up in the style of the Mad Hatter, but in white. Bette, Cher, and Flip are also dressed in white outfits trimmed out with lots of glitter as they perform \"Mockingbird,\" \"Proud Mary,\" \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough,\" and \"Never Can Say Goodbye.\" The photo below is from this medley. The tape ends with a few minutes from a TV special on Bette Midler's career Tape comes in a plain box. Ships for $1.75 book rate in the US. Please let me know if you prefer priority mail shipping.

VHS, previously viewed. Set against the dawn of the Atomic Age in l950's Las Vegas, \"Desert Bloom\" is a powerful human drama, painting an unforgettable portrait of a family struggling to unite in an increasingly frightening world. Jon Voight is Jack Chismore, a volatile war veteran, fighting to overcome his personal demons while holding his family together; JOBETH WILLIAMS is his wife Lily, torn between the needs of her family and a secret vice that threatens the very foundation of her marriage; Annabeth Gish is Rose, a delicate girl on the threshold of adolescence, struggling to understand the adults surrounding her. Into this turbulent household comes Lily's sister Starr, Ellen Barkin, a sexy divorcee who becomes the unwitting catalyst in an explosive chain reaction that rocks the Chismore family as surely--and irrevocably as the A-bomb testing in the nearby desert. Sensitively directed, brilliantly acted and superbly written, \"Desert Bloom\" is a compelling study of a family's survival and triumph in a swiftly changing world.

Our Feedback Policy We only leave feedback on those who leave feedback on us. The reason we leave feedback in this manner is both because we don't consider a transaction \"completed\" until the buyer has decided they are happy with their purchase, and also because we sell so many items (usually 500+ a week) that it would require an extra employee if we had to leave feedback first, and that would mean raising our prices, which we don't want to do. All but a handful of our 10,000+ customers are understanding on this and are willing to leave feedback first. If you are one of the few people who insist on feedback being left as soon as you make payment, PLEASE DO NOT BID ON ANY OF THE ITEMS WE SELL ON eBAY. Shipping Terms Payment Options IMPORTANT!
