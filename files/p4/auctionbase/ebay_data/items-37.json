Some Items may be wrinkled from packing and shipping, and may need to be pressed. Some but not many items may have a small spot which if I havent noted will be easily washable. BE SURE OF YOUR SIZING BEFORE BIDDING!!! NO RETURNS WILL BE ACCEPTED IF I'VE GIVEN THE CORRECT SIZE ON THE LABLE. IF YOU NEED TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT MEASUREMENTS, DO SO BEFORE BIDDING!! The VS size chart is a GUIDE and not 100% accurate for every single Victoria's Secret item. HUGO BUSCATI, THE LONDON JEAN and MODA INTERNATIONAL are VICTORIA's SECRET brands sold in VS catalogs. Please remit an additional $7.00 for S&H within 10 days of auction end. Insurance should also be included if desired. If you opt against insurance, and the post office looses or destroys your package, you agree that the seller is NOT responsible for the loss or damage. Refunds will NOT be given if you opt against insurance and the package is lost or damaged. UNINSURE AT YOUR OWN RISK. International buyers pay shipping via your choice (surface/air) Accepted methods of payment: Money Orders,BIDPAY.COM, BILLPOINT.COM I HOLD ALL CHECKS 10 BUSINESS DAYS!! Please ask questions PRIOR to bidding...THANKS! GIFT WRAPPING now available...email for details! SATISFACTION POLICY: I strive to offer only good & quality items & describe and show my items with pictures truthfully and completely.

Item should be received in the same condition as was shipped to you. VERY IMPORTANT: 1. Clothing items I state size on lable unless there isnt one in which case I try to be as accurate as possible with measurements...I concider my measurements to be APPROXIMATE since I am by no means a seamstress, however I do try to be accurate. If you require additional measurements, email me prior to bidding and I will be glad to measure anything you want. 2. Returns on clothing items will not be accepted if \"it doesnt fit\". 3. You should plan on washing or dry cleaning your item prior to wearing since most of my clothing beside the new with tags items are in preloved condition. I try to state all imperfections, but if Ive missed one that is washable or drycleanable I DO NOT concider this refundable. If there is a stain which I have missed and you return the item, a refund will only be given AFTER I have taken the article of clothing to MY dry cleaners. If the stain then comes out, a $5 restocking fee will be subracted from your end of auction bid for refund, otherwise your full bid amount excluding all shipping fees will be refunded. All refunds will be limited to the amount of your high bid. This is common practice for mail order purchases and IS NOT NEGOTIABLE. 4.

The cost to ship this wedding dress is $6, buyer pays shipping. __All items come from a smoke-free and pet free home. __All dresses are new, never rented, never worn to a wedding, store try on samples, unless otherwise noted. These dresses will need to be cleaned and pressed before they can be worn to a wedding. Some may have missing buttons, beads, dirt on the bottom, etc_ what you may expect from a try on sample. But, for the low, low price here, you can get the dress, shipping, alterations, cleaning, pressing and repairs for much less than what you would pay for the dress in a store. These dresses came from a bridal shop that closed due to illness. Many of them do not have a size tag in them, but I was told most of them are 8/10. I will always specify if there is a tag. If there is no tag and it looks like there is no way it can be an 8/10, I will tell you if it looks bigger or smaller. __If you like a dress that ends without selling, PLEASE MAKE AN OFFER. I need to get rid of these ASAP!! __Email me with questions __We accept PAYPAL AND MONEY ORDERS ONLY!! IF you pay with paypal, the money must be from a checking account, not a credit card.

This will also expedite shipping of your item. * All returned checks will be accessed a $25 service fee. Buyer to pay $5.00 for shipping and handling. All international bidders MUST email us for an adjusted S&H quote! . Ma residents pay a 5% sales tax. SHIPPING METHODS: The bidder may at any time request the shipping service of their choice, to which will be added an appropriate handling fee. MEDIA: We have been shipping media items (records, books, etc.) by Media mail, but have experienced slow delivery times, so we are trying to move away from this service. Smaller, light-weight media items over 13 ozs. are still quoted for Media mail and the bidder may request a different delivery service. However, we WILL NOT be held responsible for the long amount of time any Media mail shipment may take. SMALLER ITEMS: Other smaller items up to 13 ozs. are shipped first class. All other items are shipped either Priority mail or FedEx. Usually anything over a few pounds is shipped via FedEx, hence the higher costs. However, their exemplary service is guarenteed, carries automatic insurance up to $100 in value, and is trackable with out additional cost. Any item shipped through the USPS Priority service without requesting additional services such as delivery confirmation can not be tracked, nor will we be held responsibility for its not being delivered (see insurance disclaimer above). LARGER ITEMS: Larger items such as furniture and such are shipped either with BAX Global or a local mover we use who makes east coast runs every two-three weeks. HANDLING FEES: Since our shipping department needs to eat (and we require him to wear shoes, please! ), and shipping materials do cost money (really!) all items have an appropriate handling fee. Basically, the more time and care taken to prepare an item for safe transport, the higher the fee. We do our best to provide both cost effective and careful handling of packaging your item. This fee is not negotiable and is usually reflected in all posted S&H charges, or added to shipping quotes for larger items.

Many of the slogans employ a play on words. They're all Kenworths and Peterbilts, but when the folks in WW saw the incredible detail on First Gear's Mack mixer, they said, \"We want one of those with our name on it, even if it is a Mack!\" Well, I guess they couldn't decide which design to use on the model, so they had three different models made! Minimum quantity on a First Gear truck is usually 720 pieces, but because Koncrete was doing three at once they were allowed to have just 504 of each design manufactured. That makes this a pretty scarce replica. Add Water, Mix and Serve is the name of this version. That's the slogan printed on the mixer drum in blue block letters. The graphics are just like \"the real thing,\" even if the model is a Mack! Add it to your fleet today, or give it as a special Christmas present. I have all three versions up for sale on eBay right now, so choose your favorite or get the whole trio! The Legal Mumbo Jumbo: Successful bidder pays actual priority mail postage & insurance within the US, or actual air or surface mail postage/insurance charges to a foreign destination. Insurance is highly recommended. Payment accepted by check or money order, Visa or MasterCard (via PayPal orBidPay only), or Discover Card (via BidPay only). Money order or check must be payable in US dollars on a US bank, or a US branch of a foreign bank. If you send cash through the mail it is at your risk; I do not recommend it. If you decline insurance you assume the risk of loss or damage in transit. Insurance claims must be filed by you with the post office, as I am not an insurance company or a claims adjuster.

And its simply immaculate! This is my absolute favorite color for this time of year, a rusty, brown and light green blend, I mean these are the exact colors of beautiful Fall leaves. This is an amazingly attractive super weave amalgam of wool (51%), linen (34%) nylon (15%) crepe-like fabric, that has been perfectly cut and crafted to perfectly accentuate the form of your body....not to mention your stature in the eyes of all who are forced to enjoy watching you strut your stuff! It has to be seen and worn to be fully appreciated. Its awesome! IN BRAND SPANKING NEW, PERFECT CONDITION. This sportcoat is a light to mid weight, and comes styled with notched lapels, besom pockets, unvented, and fully lined. This coat also boasts buttons made from olive brown Ivory nut, a seed of a tropical fruit with extra high firmness, and natural grain and horn buttons three for closure and 3 on each sleeve, but with a few extra buttons in the pocket (in the Hugo Boss envelope, you know the one, the little black one...). Just one more point, have you noticed the way that many inferior (cheap) quality suits and designers place the 3 button closure too low down and too close together to really give the wearer the slimming effect that this cut traditionally provides?? Well, no worries here, its done right! These buttons are perfectly placed and spaced, WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT!!??

It is a brand spanking new three button single breasted, jacket that is made from one of the lightest softest 100% pure Camel Hair fabrics you've ever felt!! This coat is made from a chocolate brown and tan diagonally ribbed fabric that is overlaid by a mocha and white windowpane, its simple exquisite!! WITH ALL ORIGINAL TAGS FROM NEIMAN MARCUS, FOR THEIR DESIGNER COLLECTION!! THIS JACKET IS BRAND SPANKING NEW, AND GORGEOUS!! Made as the details listed below from their site attests, this current design really is a cut above the many we have offered in the past on eBay. Made for their Hickey Freeman Collection at Neiman Marcus, this suit's coat is single vented and fully lined in Bemberg, with 4 buttons on each sleeve in addition to the notched lapels and flap pockets. The coat is darted for accentuated fit and the appearance of manly wide shoulders with an athletically slim waist...(even if its not exactly the case!) THIS JACKET IS ABSOLUTELY BRAND SPANKING NEW, WITH ALL ORIGINAL TAGS!! Here's some info on HICKEY FREEMAN and their \"labors of love\" Fabric One of the first things you may notice when looking at a Hickey-Freeman suit is the elegance and finesse of the fabric. Textiles from the finest mills of Italy and Great Britain are woven from rich, lustrous yarns of wool and silk. The textures, patterns and colors are designed to ensure the distinctive, exclusive look that is Hickey-Freeman's hallmark. Canvas Front Construction Hickey-Freeman uses the finest canvas for interlinings, the canvas front is an exclusive light-weight construction that adds lasting shape and body to the coat front without the heavy stiffness of lesser quality canvas. Fit The Hickey-Freeman garment is immediately noticed in the graceful way the coat lapel rolls and in the way the coat front hugs the chest like a second skin. Bemberg Lining Hickey-Freeman coats are lined with Bemberg lining the \"gold standard\" of linings. Sponging/Inspecting While high quality fabrics and trimmings are pre-shrunk at the mill, Hickey-Freeman subjects these products to a second conditioning process to ensure predictable, uniform behavior throughout manufacturing and the life of the garment. Re-conditioning of fabrics, thread, pocketing, and interlining assures you of long-lasting comfort, fit, and appearance. Undercollars The Hickey-Freeman undercollar interlining is made of fine Irish linen. It is \"married\" to the undercollar cloth, a woven wool flannel (not a pressed \"felt\"). As a result, the interlining has resilience and body characteristics that are transferred to the coat collar. The undercollar is made of two parts, rather than one, to ensure an easy, natural \"hug\" to the curve of the neck. Silk Thread Most sewing operations are accomplished with silk thread. Silk provides strength, elasticity, and \"memory\" (it returns to its original length after being stretched) plus reliable color brilliance and fastness. Silk gives seams a soft, thin, and flexible characteristic while holding up to the constant stresses of daily wear, dry cleanings and pressings. Buttons Turned from the horns of the water buffalo and Mother-of-Pearl shells, Hickey-Freeman's buttons offer durability and a richness of color and texture that are unmatched by man-made materials. Hand Pressing Hand pressing sets the fit, style and appearance of each coat. Linings, darts, outside pockets, side seams, shoulder seams, front edges and facings are hand pressed by experienced pressers. Hand Tailoring The buttonholes of a Hickey-Freeman coat are hand sewn with long-wear silk thread over a fine twist-free linen gimp. Hand-sewn buttonholes yield durability with a soft, flexible feel. Hickey-Freeman's list of hand tailoring includes: Hand-fitted armhole and shoulder settings. Hand fitted vents. Hand sewn buttonholes and bar tacks. Neck hanger. Micro-hand-stitched label. Pressing and finishing of linings. Side and shoulder seams. Pockets. Collar corner and vent felling. All ensure that each and every garment achieves that perfect feel, the precise fit, and the lasting impression that makes a Hickey-Freeman feel like a second skin.

HERE IS AN EXCERPT FROM THE CNN ARTICLE: (CNN) -- It was the jacket that helped change the rules of fashion. In 1975, Giorgio Armani introduced what became known as the deconstructed jacket, a loose, informal coat that proved to be a radical break from the conservative or offbeat clothing that came before. New York's Guggenheim Museum recognizes Armani's considerable contributions in a retrospective that features about 400 of his fashions. The show examines the cultural impact of his designs. It's the first time the museum has dedicated one show to an individual designer, and it's said to be the largest one-man fashion exhibition ever presented in New York. The Armani company is now worth more than $2 billion with a retail network that covers 33 countries. \"Fashion is at the heart of human expression, and is a mirror that reflects society and its culture,\" he said. \"My philosophy has always been to help women and men feel comfortable and confident through the clothes that they wear, rather than to create decoration for the sake of it. This belief continues to be at the root of my work as we enter the new millennium.\" SO I HOPE THAT YOU WILL LOVE THE EXPERIENCE OF OWNING AND WEARING THIS COAT. BID AWAY!!

Tag says size M and cotton/poly blend. This shirt has buttons going all the way down, not pullover type. (for search purposes Kahala Tori Richard St. st Tommy Bahama Reyn Spooner Ono Manoa Jams Jamsworld)) I realize how hard it is to be buying clothes online, not knowing how it looks while being worn or if it fits right etc. My solution for this is to allow you as the high bidder to return the item after you receive it should you not like it AT YOUR OWN EXPENSE for a full refund of your winning bid. I will just relist it and sell it again, and you will just be out what it costs to ship back. Hows that, OK!?! Please read my terms twice so that you fully understand... High bidder to pay $2.85 for USPS AIR in the US. Yeah, postage went up July 1, sorry. Outside US slightly higher. I will accept PayPal, money orders, or personal checks, but will hold your personal check until it clears before making shipment. I WILL WRITE THIS AGAIN...I WILL ACCEPT PAYPAL, MONEY ORDERS, OR PERSONAL CHECKS. I'm sorry about that, but some people can't read and still insist on using Billpoint for some reason even after reading my ads. Check my feedback and you'll see that I'm totally on top of everything. Bid with confidence. Note: Bidding on items has been known to cause people to not receive paychecks on time, people to find out that their kids used their passwords and bid on items without permission, people to delete my e-mails by accident, sickness, sudden memory loss, deaths in the family, people to lose jobs, computers to crash, out of town vacations, emergency business trips, hardware failures, network outages, and people to move places of residence among other things. If you feel that by bidding on this item you will aquire one of these aforementioned aflictions, then DO NOT BID ON THIS ITEM!! I've heard um all and I'm sick of DEADBEAT BIDDERS!! I leave big negative feedback for deadbeat bidders. Another Note: Please do not send me e-mails complaining about what I charge for shipping. Usually I just charge what it costs to ship. However, if for some reason I should happen to receive more, rest assured that in addition to postage, your shipping $$$ goes towards brown wrap, bubble wrap, packing tape, boxes, packing peanuts, bubble mailers, rubber stamps, etc etc where applicable. If you do not like what I charge for shipping, then simply do not bid on this item. I EXPECT A REPLY to my initial e-mails and for payment to be sent in a timely manner...I don't think that's too much to expect, is it? Sorry for venting, but if I don't write all of this, you wouldn't believe the number of bonehead e-mails I get...
