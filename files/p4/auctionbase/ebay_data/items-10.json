Moose s blanket is emblazoned with a maple leaf and the hat on his head looks suspiciously like standard issue for the RCMP (Royal Canadian Murphy/Moose Police). The area is littered with beer bottles and cans. A few are even stuck in Moose s antlers and a keg is under his belly. Moose has strapped a second keg around his neck, just in case he gets lost or stranded as he evades the RMCP. For ammunition the desperadoes have stockpiled snowballs for those sudden battles with Sgt. Jacques Strappe. The ten snowballs represent Canada s ten provinces. Inside the box is Mad Murphy, who has again foiled the RCMP s attempts to find and capture him. Carvings include Rich Little, a famous Canadian impersonator; DB McKenzie for two well-known brothers; Sir John EH for Sir John A. McDonald, Canada s first Prime Minister, and a play on the Canadian expression eh ; and BA (heart) BA stands for Bryan Amyot loves Brenda Amyot (his wife). Item is mint with box.

I doubt if the blades would do coffee, but I could be mistaken. POssibly garlic, or other herb type garden items or spices. The metal handle turns the blades inside the little shoot that holds the nuts to be ground. As they get pieced into little bits, they fall into the Androck jar below. The blue and black and white design feels very early 50's maybe even 40's, and since the number 49 is on the jar, I would place it in this time frame. The blades are somewhat rusty and would need some cleaning it you planned on actually using this. But if you're just adding to your decor in a retro kitchen, it would be fine as it is. Ther is a little bit of ridges on one side, the lowest, and looks like a match striker to me, so maybe this piece did double duty when setting on or near a stove that had to be lit. I cannot think of any other use for the ridges, so if you know, please let me know. Bid early and stake your claim to this unusual piece. See pics and email questions.

We do not use ebay's \"Checkout\" option. We accept paypal. Winner to pay shipping. Non smoking environment. We ship via UPS or the Postal Service and are not responsible for uninsured items shipped via the Postal Service that are lost or damaged. We recommend to those of you that have your packages shipped via the Postal Service that you purchase Postal Delivery Confirmation (.40-$1.50) but we will not include this charge unless asked. This is the only method the Postal Service has of tracking your package. If you do not purchase this all we can tell you is the date your package was shipped. Items shipped using UPS are automatically insured. ALL international orders, as well as all shipments to PO Boxes in the U.S., are sent ONLY by the United States Postal Service. Please note that the selvage may have one small hole every yard. The selvage is usually a narrow strip of fabric that runs along both sides of the material and is not used for upholstering. These small holes will in no way effect the use of the fabric. The holes are a result of the way that we sometimes measure short pieces. Please ask any questions you might have about the item BEFORE you bid. If you have any reservations please do not bid as all sales are final. At auctions end we will send the winning bidder an email asking for their address so that we can calculate shipping charges. Due to space limitations we will only consolidate up to ten days worth of winning bids. The ten days begin after the first piece that you win closes. Unfortunately there are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule as we are operating out of a small space and simply do not have the room to consolidate indefinitely. If you do wish to consolidate it is your responsibility to keep track of what you have won.

You get issue #227 in this auction. I don't know alot about comic books, but I will tell you what I can about this one. I think that this one is from the 1960's and was printed in Australia. Just inside the front cover at the bottom of the page it says the following: Distributors-Gordon & Gotch (A'sia) LTD., Sydney Melbourne. On the bottom of the last page it says the following: Printed by Rotary Colorprint Co. Pty. Ltd., 15 Hamilton St., Sydney. Published by Frew Publications Pty. Limited, 149 Castlereagh St., Sydney. The cover is printed in color and the interior pages are all Black & White. The comic contains 32 pages and has a price of 1 pound(?)on the front cover. The cover is a newspaper type paper and does not have the glossy type finish as most comic books do. The comic is in what I would call Excellent condition, maybe better, no major tears. There is no writing on the cover or inside that I have found. The comic measures about 10\"x7\". Please ask questions before bidding, and I will try to answer them the best that I can.

This is a terrific film about women struggling to discover a way to find and develop their identity. While some of the allusions and metaphors can be a bit heavy handed, they are effective. Eve (Tilda Swinton) is a lawyer about to be nominated for a judgeship. While her professional life is as much as she could wish, her personal life is a mess. She is involved with an architect (male) and a psychotherapist, Renee. But she is unable to connect with either. Her upbringing, devotion to her work, and desperate desire for control have left her emotionally stunted, unable to make a real connection to anyone around her. One day, her sister is picked up for shoplifting. Eve rides to her rescue, and spends several days in the middle of nowhere, with an exotic dancer, a young girl just entering puberty, and a brilliant but shattered friend. Many critics hated this movie (most guides give it just 2 or 3 stars) but I think they couldn't get past Eve's coldness. But this movie is a study in coldness, in emotional death and rebirth. But it is not Eve who is reborn. See it and judge for yourself._K_K Country: USA 1996 NTSC Brand New & Factory Sealed! ALL CODES so that it is playable worldwide!!!

These cards are just tough to find now. So ground rules i will only accept United states postal money orders for payments and nothing else, no personal checks, cash, nothing but united states postal money orders. There are two reasons 1st USP MO can be cashed at any post office therefore items can be sent out quicker since i dont have to wait for MO's or personal checks to clear, therefore transactions are quicker. i just opened a paypal account if you can send a payment wihout me incur fees maybe i might accept payment by this form but please email me first. i absoloutelly will not incur fees to get money from buyers, i can wait for the mail to get MO's instead of losing money. otherwise A united states postal money order is the only form of payment i accept. Shipping for one card can either be $2 for the card to be insured for up to $49 and sent in a regular envelope first class mail and only items sent for under $49 can be sent this way otherwise priority mail has to be used so the item can be insured for more or $4.60 for priority insured for up to $49 dollors the more items you buy the more the posibility you have to have the items sent priority mail cost could be more if items have to be insured for more. Insurance forupto $99 and priority is $5.50, priority and insurance for upto $199 is $6.60, priority and insurance for upto $299 is $7.70 and each additional $100 increment is an additional $1.10. its stronglly recommended you buy multiple items so that the cost of shipping and insurance makes sense. if you have any further questions please feel free to email me. If the transaction is not compleated negative feedback will be posted. also please check under sellers other auctions to see if there are other sets or cards you need.

We bought items from local sellers, but that was not without a large price tag, as I_m sure we can all relate to :) Our passion for sports memorabilia progressed into wanting to meet our favorite players, so we went through different contacts and getting our autographs that way. Now we travel all over to different events getting autographs in person, hand signed by top athletes and celebrities of today and yesterday. Now I must let you know, that we still DO PURCHASE autographs, and NOT every autograph we sell has been witnessed by us, however we do OUR VERY BEST to ensure that the autographs we sell are only TOP QUALITY and 100% real. That is why we issue a CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY from Spotlight Productions, backed with our full refund guarantee that if you are not completely satisfied with your product, SEND IT BACK ! We don_t want anyone to ever have any displeasure associated with our name! And we mean that!

Capacities range from 20 to 60 GB. An Ultra ATA/100 interface optimizes system performance. Unique design attributes enable shock protection to 400 G. Reduced acoustics enable extremely quiet operation at 3.1 Bels. Idle power consumes only 6.7 watts. Leading drive technology The IBM Deskstar 60GXP disk drive combines new and proven technologies to greatly enhance system performance and capacity--handling a wide range of advanced desktop and audio/video applications. Features such as low acoustics, reduced power, and tagged command queuing are ideal for low-cost routers, entry- level servers, and switches. Advanced desktop systems IBM continues to define state-of-the-art for storage. The high capacities and fast speeds of IBM Deskstar drives support higher quality digital audio/video storage, superior digital content creation capabilities, and significantly faster processing for multimedia and Internet applications. Technology for performance Increased track capacity and servo bandwidth combine with enhanced buffer throughput to significantly improve performance over the previous generation IBM drive. A 2 MB buffer uses advanced buffer management and hardware assisted caching to streamline data transfer. In addition, more servo pulses help ensure faster and more accurate head positioning to reduce head settling time. The IBM Deskstar 60GXP also supports Tagged Command Queuing and Rotational Position Optimization to further enhance throughput for data-intensive Windows NT** and UNIX** applications. Technology for reliability The industry's highest areal density increases capacity while reducing component count to improve reliability. Second-generation load/unload head ramps help protect data from drive mishandling, further enhancing reliability. In addition, glass media provides a smoother disk surface and greater rigidity to reduce the impact of shock. Ceramic spindle bearings and a tri-lamenate top cover reduce acoustics to just 3.1 Bels--a level that matches or improves upon many 5400 RPM models. Circuits and motors are also optimized to save power and reduce system temperature- extending system life and reliability. Deskstar drives utilize proven IBM technologies such as TrueTrack* servo and No- ID* sector formatting, as well as IBM Drive Fitness Test* (DFT), S.M.A.R.T. Self Test, and error logging. _ IBM Deskstar 60GXP at a glance Configuration Interface ATA Capacity (GB) 60GB Sector size (bytes) 512 Recording zones 18 User cylinders (physical) 27,724 Data heads (physical) 6/4/2 Data disks 3/2/1 Max. areal density (Gbits/sq. inch) 15.3 Max. recording density (BPI) 449k Track density (TPI) 34,000 Performance Data buffer 2MB Rotational speed (RPM) 7200 Latency (average ms) 4.17 Media transfer rate (max Mbits/sec) 494 Interface transfer rate (max MB/sec) 100 Sustained data rate (MB/sec) 20.9 to 40.8 Seek time (read typical) _ _Average (ms) 8.5 _ _Track-to-track (ms) 1.2 _ _Full-track (ms) 15.0 Reliability Error rate (nonrecoverable) 1 in 10E13 Start stop cycles (load/unload at 40_ C) 40,000 Power Requirement +5 VDC (+- 5%), +12 VDC (+10%/-8%) Dissipation (typical) _ _Startup current _ _(max A) 2.0(12v) _ _Idle (W) 6.7(3,2,1 disks) Physical size Height (mm) 25.4 Width (mm) 101.6 Depth (mm) 146 Weight (max g) 590 (3 disks), 575 (2 disks), 560 (1 disk) Environmental characteristics _ Operating Nonoperating Ambient temperature 5 to 55_ C -40 to 65_ C Relative humidity (noncondensing) 8% to 90% 5% to 95% Maximum wet bulb (noncondensing) 29.4_ C 35_ C Shock (half sine wave) 55_G/2_ms 400 G (2, 1 disks)_ 350 G (3 disks)_ _ Vibration (random [RMS]) 0.67 G_for_horizontal, 0.56_for_vertical 1.04 G Acoustics (idle) Bels 3.1 (3 disks), 3.0 (2 disks), 2.9 (1 disk) _ The above information exerted from IBM website.
