This is a Greek history story that was not printed in any other country. We are now auctioning Greek Classics Illustrated comics that were published in the 1970_s. The Greek Classics had a different numbering system than the U.S. so I will identify the Classics with the U.S. Classics Illustrated numbers. Many of the Greek Classics have new painted covers that are very colorful and did not appear in the U.S. Some U.S. covers were redrawn or repainted so that the final cover is a little different from the U.S. cover. For some classics they had an artist redraw the U.S. inside art so that the finished art is a little different from the original U.S. art. The Greek Classics also printed most of the 80 new classics that were printed in Europe and not in the U.S. The Greek Classics Illustrated series also printed Greek history and mythology stories that did not appear in any other country. The Greek Classics Illustrated comics have the whitest pages of any classics comic printed in any country as they used a high quality white paper in printing their comics. Most Greek Classics have a price sticker on the bottom corner of the back cover. The overall quality is the best done by any country so if you decide to collect foreign classics then Greek Classics is the country to start with. Collecting foreign Classics Illustrated is a great hobby. Having your favorite classic in a foreign language is an excellent addition to your classics collection. The Greek Classics Illustrated is the most popular of the foreign classics in a foreign language since they are a little easier to obtain and have bright colorful covers. A collector has a good chance to complete a collection of Greek Classics while this is difficult to do with other foreign countries. All bids in U.S. funds. Shipping and handling for the U.S. and Canada is 3.50. All other countries can email me for the postage cost. If you win more than one comic or combine this comic with previous bids you have won then add 1.00 postage on each additional comic. Satisfaction is guaranteed or return for immediate refund. Payment can be by money order, cashier_s check, or personal check. We accept credit card payments by Billpoint or Paypal for instant payment. We also accept Bidpay.

Faux Facts (A story from the manufacturer): \"Frank and George had been good friends for years when an old unresolved conflict led to a fist throwing fight between the two. George was left a broken jaw that required his mouth to be wired shut. Frank was left unscathed but feeling quilty. One day George had a craving for apple pie. Frank wanted to oblige. Short on ingredients and cash (since he was paying the medical bills), Frank decided to improvise. In the cabinet he found some Apple Schnapps and Cinnamon Schnapps. Since all George's food had to be blended so it could be consumed through a straw, Frank decided he wouldn't know the difference (especially after a couple of \"slices\"). Frank was right. George loved it and today, with a healed jaw, often prefers the liquid version over the baked one.\" Dimensions : 2.25\" tall x 1.75\" diameter Condition: Mint Shipping Cost: $5.05, insured shipping inside the USA.

Black Mask is an adaptation of a Hong Kong comic book, with added touches of BLADE RUNNER and BATMAN. \"Squad 701\" is a team of professional killers who have undergone brain surgery and no longer feel pain or emotion. When it is discovered that some of these assassins are still capable of feeling, it is decided to \"exterminate\" the whole squad. Some do manage to escape in time, with one of them being \"Black Mask\" (Jet Li). He goes into hiding in Hong Kong and finds employment in a library under the false identity of Tsui Chik, and is soon befriended by a cop named Shek (Lau Ching-wan), known on the force for his cold attitude. Meanwhile, a group of assassins lead by one member of the late \"Squad 701\", is killing every major Hong Kong drug dealer in order to control the whole territory. Upon realizing that Shek is unsuccessful in stopping them, Tsui decides to again assume the identity of Black Mask, but this time in the name of justice. 2 CDs in one jewel case, brand new, sealed.

This third book in a series still employs the unique catalog number system, combining a three-letter code with a three-number code, and providing a quick reference guide for shot glass collectors of any degree. The book features large, detailed line drawings of more than 1,400 shot glasses, arranged alphabetically by catalog number in one continuous section. The catalog number below each glass gives clues as to the type of ware, geographical origin, and date of manufacture, while guiding the reader to additional information in the main description and pricing guide. A brief caption is also included directly below each shot glass for searching at-a-glance. The new encyclopedia features selected shot glasses shown in the first two books, plus an additional 1,000 new finds. Prefaced by a brief history of the international development of shot glasses, this book is user- friendly and collector-friendly with an emphasis on learning how to determine value. Pickvet educates the reader on approximating value in his general pricing guide. He also includes good and mint prices for each of the more than 4,000 shot glasses listed. This book is 336 pages and is a new and unused paperback. It is one among a number of books on collecting we have listed on eBay. To see current prices and pictures of all my auctions, click here.

Description Original \"Mars Attacks\" cards today are one of, if not the most sought-after non-sports cards issued over the last 50 years! In 1962 a sense of innocence among kids changed when Topps introduced its historic \"Mars Attacks\" 55 card set, featuring blood, giant insects and large headed aliens graphically illustrated using bright vivid colors, by legendary artist Norm Saunders! This card set was issued for only one year (1962) after numerous parental complaints helped cease production. Presented for auction is this 1962 Topps \"Mars Attacks\" card #30 and titled \"Trapped!\" The offered card has been conservatively graded and encapsulated by PSA (highly respected authentication & grading service) in a EX-MT 6 holder. Displaying bright, bold, vivid color, with nice white borders & corners, exhibiting fabulous eye appeal of this most treasured issue of the last half-century. A centering anomaly and factory mis-cuts, which are common to non-sports issues, with quality-control focused more in the sporting side of the industry, is apparently what prevented PSA from grading higher! Please look at our nearly complete set of Mars Attacks and other graded non-sports cards we are offering for auction this week. As with all our auctions there is No Reserve!

This is really neat since it really took some work to encase this glass bottle in a fashion similar to the way the keg are made with wood fitted slats that are then banded to make them seal. This stands about 9\" tall and almost 3 1/2\" thick. It appears that different types of natural wood were used to make the encasement for this bottle. This one says \"Navip\" and Plum Brandy- Slivovitz on one side and on the other it looks like \"Sapaakanta\" , Ciapa Miszhbobnua\". I am sure that isn't totally correct but for those who understand the language it should lead you in the proper understanding. It has a screw on cap which also says \"Navip\" on top. I must assume that at one time there was a wood cover for the cap but it is missing as is a small portion that surrounds the neck of the glass bottle inside. This bottle also has a inch wide multicolor strap that encircles the outer edge. This may be from Yugoslavia also since at least one of the 4 that I bought at the same household states that it was from there. Other than the wooden neck cover, there are no nicks or cracks and it still makes a nice decorator piece. Buyer pays 6.50 shipping. I do combine for shipping savings so please look at all of the others.
