First is a darling little pink hooded sweatshirt with Minnie Mouse in a heart on the front, and mouse ears on the black hood; brand name \"Disney Babies,\" made by Walt Disney Co. It is made of 100% acrylic, and the tag shows it is for infants 16 1/2 to 20 pounds. The paint on Minnie's face is beginning to show a little bit of wear, but the construction of the sweatshirt is in excellent condition. Next we have a long-sleeve sweatshirt that is light yellow in color with assorted flowers all over it; brand name \"Garanimals\". It has a yellow scalloped band on the neckline and solid yellow edging on the sleeves and the bottom. It is made of 60% cotton and 40% polyester. The front of the shirt does have some spots on it, and I am not sure if they will come out in the wash or not. The last item is a pair of 100% cotton bib overalls by McKids (with the golden arches) from the McDonald's Corp. They are a light green corduroy with red and purple flowers all over them. The area on the sides at the waist have elastic for a comfortable fit and they have a snap crotch for easy diaper changing. They have been worn, but they are in extremely good condition.

Buyers feel free to use the instant purchase logo from Paypal on this site. You don't even have to wait until notification. If you win more than one item pay only once through paypal since they charge a fee for each transaction. 6.50 for shipping/handling priority mail.
