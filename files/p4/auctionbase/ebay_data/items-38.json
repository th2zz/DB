A TRIPLE STRAND MIKIMOTO necklace. This absolutely stunning necklace almost never appears on eBay. It is authenticated as Mikimoto by a Certified Graduate Gemologist (GIA)-AGA. You have three strands of nearly flawless pearls with a total of 277 pearls graduating from 3.7mm to 7.3mm. Color is a very light cream with a very light ros_ overtone with a thick nacre--classic, high-end Mikimoto. Not least, the luster is simply superb. This is where it counts! The GIA appraisal accords it a very high AA status. (Another appraiser certified this triple strand necklace as AA+!) The strands are extremely well-matched, a Mikimoto specialty. When you're matching 277 pearls you must have thousands of pearls from which to choose to make one superbly matched necklace. This is why Mikimoto is renowned and it shows here. The strands are 15 and 1/2 to 17 and 1/2 inches long, with a sterling silver Mikimoto clasp adorned with a 4.2mm pearl. Both appraisals are available for your inspection. This is a no-risk Mikimoto triple strand! The photos don't even begin to capture the stellar luster and exquisite matching of this rare Mikimoto triple strand. Condition is absolutely MINT! Walk into ANY Mikimoto dealer and you'll see that a triple strand of this quality sells for $5,000. Yet the reserve on this triple strand is very near the WHOLESALE price! This is THE holiday gift of the year. Shipping and insurance are to be paid by the buyer. Payment is by cashier's check, Western Union or PAYPAL. BUY WITH CONFIDENCE!

Have you thought about using eBay for your Christmas gifts? You can stretch your shopping dollars a great deal! Following is my Seller's info that applies to all items. (Please click on View Seller's Other Auctions or search by Seller ID Duckfeed to keep up with my offerings. My auctions end at all different times, including daytime hours.) I will combine items for shipping to save you money. My maximum hold on items while waiting for other auctions to finish is 7 days. Payment is expected within TEN (10) days of close of sale. Please be sure to list item name and item number on Paypal or Billpoint, or with your money order or check. All items are sold \"as is\" with no returns. See my high-volume positive feedback, and you will see that I sell quality merchandise. I accept Billpoint, Paypal, money orders (and checks with hold if you have a lot of positive eBay feedback). Clothing I sell can be described as \"better quality\" clothing of a designer name brand purchased in Nordstroms, Macys, Saks, Niemans, Grodins, Talbots, Casual Corner, Ann Taylor, etc. All items are used, and most items look new. See my other auctions. I don't put anything on auction that I would not wear myself or ask my man-friend to wear. I have a long time corporate background and know what career clothing comprises the \"dress for success\" look. I am human and do my very best to represent items honestly, point out any flaws I find, and leave you feeling great about what you buy. I work very hard to offer consistent positive customer service. If I miss an obvious flaw in my description, I will deal with you with integrity. Colors are sometimes distorted, as it's hard to get all the software to work together with total accuracy. I try to describe colors. YOU MAY NEED TO DRY CLEAN OR LAUNDER THE ITEM, according to its label instructions, although some items will not need it. Because my profit margin is low and because the items usually get pretty wrinkled in transit, I do not invest in dry cleaning most items prior to sale. Just compare what you would pay for the item in a department store, and the dry cleaning cost will seem minimal. :) You will most likely need to press a garment after its journey through the mail. Please do not cancel your bid. We sellers appreciate it if you wait to bid until you are sure. Bidders who frivolously cancel truly jeopardize a seller's income and can scare other bidders away. Read everything carefully, and please stick with the bid if you bid. Be sure to look at the other auctions by Duckfeed. I have a lot of beautiful, quality clothing and vintage collectibles.

First of all, it can be worn fully zipped via the two large front zippers and the fully wraparound waist zipper. Next, for a very sexy look you can unzip the center zipper which will show a 2.5\" stretchy band of somewhat transparent black netting (and we all know what else will show!). You can \"vary\" the look by showing just as much as you want by adjusting how low the zipper goes. As you can see in the pictures, the back of the piece has a large velcro closure flap. I'm not really sure what this does, though. 100% guaranteed authentic, with all hang tags, certificates of authenticity and labels attached. It's hard to assess the value of this piece as it's sold out in the U.S. stores even at full retail. Pieces like this sell for $1200 to $2500 though they seldom stay in stock. Fabric Content: Outside Shell is a cordura blend of nylon, polyester and polyurethane with the feel of soft canvas. The lining is poly blend plush short pile fleece. The piece is trimmed in genuine leather.

Presenting a fabulous suit w/pleated slacks from HSM. This is a newer issue with their \"softly tailored\" line of wools. The size is marked 54 long. Be sure and check the specific measurements below for all the details on fit. The fabric is soft and luxurious. The weight works year around. The color is solid gray. The jacket is a 2 button single breasted style, fully lined with a single vent. The slacks are double pleated, cuffed and lined to below the knees. The condition is . superb. The only flaw I could find on the suit is a tiny pin prick hole on the left sleeve near the shoulder (see the last photo). To me, this is a total non-issue. I seriously doubt anyone will even notice this because it's so small. Other than that, the suit is perfect. Here are the specific measurements: JACKET Sleeve (from shoulder hem to end of sleeve) 26\" w/1 1/2\" that could be let out. Shoulder (from shoulder hem to shoulder hem) 22\" Length (from bottom of collar in back to bottom hem) 32\" Chest (from side to side underneath arms while coat is laying down, then doubled) 58\" PANTS Waist 50 1/2\" w/3\" that could be let out. Inseam (inside seam from crotch to cuff) 30\" w/2 1/2\" that could be let out to keep the cuff. Outseam (outside seam from top of beltline to cuff) 43 1/2\" Some of my auctions may end during the day. Please be aware of this and bid early if you won't have access to the internet during the day.

The fabric is a brilliant green satin- which catches every bit of light- and a black velvet bodice. This fabric really gleams with iridescent reflection! I don't think the photos really capture this. The cut of the bodice provides a very flattering fit. The skirt angles higher towards the left leg. This style creates an attractive, elegant walk. A layer of crinoline enhances the skirt from beneath. The neckline is off the shoulder with a coordinating bow on the left. The dress is labeled a size 3, and it will easily fit a petite 1/2 or a girl size 14/16 without need for any adjustments. No guesswork involved; measurements are for a 32-34 bust, 27-30 waist, and a height of 5'0\"-5'5\". It is possible this dress will fit a ladie's typical label size 4. However, a girl of that size, who once borrowed the dress, commented it was a tight fit for most of her evening. This dress is in excellent, like new condition with no rips or stains! The price is great, too! This dress is perfect for Winter Formal dances and a great holiday dress for New Year's Eve parties. Email your questions.

Buyer pays shipping fees and we are happy to combine items if you win more than one of our auctions. The second item can usually be added at almost no additional charge. We ship all items USPS Priority Mail and always add a delivery comfirmation. Please DO NOT ask us to ship a different method unless it is absolutely necessary. We ship Priority mail because they provide free shipping supplies and we can easliy figure shipping costs. We do not try to make money on shipping, and in fact many times we loose money on it. If you feel the shipping costs are excessive, please DO NOT BID. Insurance is extra at the buyer's discretion. Most times, insurance can be added for less than 1.00, so we do advise it, as we cannot be responsible for items once we have shipped them. Shipping amount is for buyers who have a shipping address in the continental USA only. Please email us before sending payment if you live outside of the continental USA. We accept PayPal too. Winning bidder should respond by email (noland@cyberzane.net) within 48 hours of winning bid. Thanks so much for looking at our item.

HOLIDAY SHIPPING OPTIONS FOR THE USA We ship almost everything using the US Post Office. If the shipping charge stated is less than $3.50, the item is shipped via first class mail which is normally 2 to 4 days to anywhere in the USA. There is no delivery confirmation available on this and packages in rare instances have taken up to two weeks to arrive (way less than 1% of the time). Past history in shipping tells us that the Post Office actually does a very good job in December, yet with the volume of mail they process, packages do sometimes get misrouted. All items with a stated shipping charge of $3.50 or more are already shipped via priority mail, most with a delivery confirmation. Priority mail shipping with a delivery confirmation number sent to you is available on any item we sell where the shipping charge is stated at under $3.50. The cost for this is $4 and applies to the ties and most of the small ornaments that we are selling. If you want this service just submit $4 in place of any lower shipping amount stated and we will ship priority mail. Express mail overnight shipping is also available at a cost of $13.00 up to 8 ounces (single ties), 8 ounces to 2 pounds at $17 (most plates) and 2 to 3 pounds, $20. This is guaranteed overnight to most of the USA but may take two days to more rural areas. If you want to use this service have your payment in by noon CST or call me at 847-924-8744 and I will let you know if I will be able to get the item out that day. Any questions, feel free to call me at the number above. Please click here to see all of our auctions. We will not be shipping from 12/28/01 to 1/6/02, resuming on 1/7/02.
