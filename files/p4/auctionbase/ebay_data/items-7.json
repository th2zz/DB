I just love this hat! It's just too cute! Made of an extremely soft, velvety black wool velour with a black satin hatband. Tiny little brim to sit cocked at an angle on the head. But the crowning glory has got to be that FEATHER! I'm not sure what type of feather is is (curly ostrich?), but it's really something: very full, curly and lush, designed to curl at an angle away from the hat. Feather tips/quills are covered with a rhinestone mesh cylinder, with the stones all prong set (and all there!) Has two small flaps to grip onto the head; they're double layered and have begun to separate, but just need a dot of glue. From The Halle Bros. Co., a now defunct high-end department store here in Cleveland. In excellent condition, no stains or damage (except for head flaps mentioned before). Size 22.

We want you to know that we do our best to describe the item up for auction with as much detail without going overboard. All items are usually purchased from an estate sale, therefore, they have been previously owned and/or used. We will never claim an item to be \"Mint\" for that reason. You may find something that is a flaw that we did not notice. We are not perfect. And, there may be times that as a collector there is something specific to look for that we do not know anything about, so it is up to you to ask the questions, and educate us along the way. We like and encourage that. Therefore, If you have questions, please ask and we will do our best to answer them. We accept money orders and PayPal. Unfortunately, we no longer accept checks due to losses that we have encountered. We hope you like what we sell, and if there is something you are looking for ask us, we just might have it, lol.

Many animals were left homeless by the tragedy on September 11th, as their owners were killed, left homeless, or called to service. The shelters are struggling with the expense of caring for and finding homes for these loving pets For more information, please contact NEW YORKERS FOR COMPANION ANIMALS PO Box 20247 New York, NY 10025 (212) 427-8273 NYFCA@aol.com PLEASE READ THIS: https://www.geocities.com/~nyca/ REMEMBER: There are thousands and thousands of good, loving animals in shelters all over the country. Many of them are euthanized, because shelters cannot handle the sheer volume or do not have the financial resources to provide for them. If you have room in your heart and in your home, PLEASE, consider checking out your local shelter. In thirty years, I have had dozens of pets, all of which were all adopted from shelters. They have all proved to be WONDERFUL, dedicated pets who provided me with love and companionship, brought me comfort and made me laugh. Even the scroungiest animals who may appear too old, poorly trained, difficult, or otherwise imperfect, can turn out to be the most loving, appreciative pet. They only need the love and attention of a caring owner. PLEASE ADOPT!! YOU WON_T BE SORRY!!! !!! Happy Holidays !!! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

This eye-catching quilt has framed 4-Point stars in distinctive _on-point_ blocks which are color-set to create a 3-dimensional optical illusion. Although each block is pieced exactly the same way, some blocks appear to be rising off the quilt while other blocks appear to be receding deeply into the quilt. The individual stars are framed in patchwork and the central medallion is enclosed in a final, blue, double border. This remarkable quilt is hand-quilted, and it is an engaging quilt that would make a gorgeous wall hanging or show piece and is perfectly usable as a quilt. Notice the close-ups of a portion of this wonderful vintage look quilt and a sham. This dazzling quilt is new and has distinct graphic appeal!

PLEASE, NO PERSONAL CHECKS. Your item will be shipped on the following day after payment is received. All major shipping accounts will be honored, otherwise I will ship USPS Priority Mail (2 to 3 day service). If you have any questions about the above listed item, please e-mail me and I will do my best to help you. ********************PLEASE READ******************** I do not run auctions on a casual basis just to use my spare or idle time. Auctioning to me, is a serious business that I do not take lightly and expect that the others involved (on the bidding end) feel the same way. With this in mind, if you feel there is something in my auction you do not agree with, please contact me and I will address your concerns to the best of my ability. Whenever possible, I provide my bidders with a FIXED, not actual, cost of shipping and handling. I evaluate each of my items on an individual basis for such costs and these charges reflect the USPS shipping rate for that item plus a nominal fee to cover other costs such as handling, and packing materials needed to secure the purchased item(s). As such, my shipping terms are very straight forward and are not subject to reevaluation, unless there are sever circumstances where the item is either very heavy or awkward, in which case I usually state the total cost for shipping will be determined \"BY YOUR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION\". This allows me to give a fairer price for shipping and handling fees and cater to my bidders on a more personal level. In such cases, you are still subject to a FIXED cost for shipping and handling , so please do not complain after you are committed to the purchase. Since it is difficult for me to determine where a bidder lives, I ask my bidders to find out about shipping costs before placing their bids on my items, so as to eliminate any problems about shipping costs. One last note: I state that payment is due within 10 days of the end of the auction. This means that the total payment for the item (winning bid) plus the cost of shipping, handling and insurance charges are due!! If partial payments are made in error, I will contact you about the problem and expect an expeditious reply and payment. Please contact me with any further questions. Thank You for looking and good luck bidding!"}, {"ItemID": "1048702141", "Name": "Hallmark Keepsake-People Friendly Ornament", "Category": ["Collectibles", "Decorative & Holiday", "Decorative by Brand", "Hallmark", "Ornaments"], "Currently": "$2.00", "First_Bid": "$2.00", "Number_of_Bids": "0", "Bids": null, "Location": "Northern Illinois", "Country": "USA", "Started": "Dec-14-01 17:09:20", "Ends": "Dec-21-01 17:09:20", "Seller": {"UserID": "carterl@essex1.com", "Rating": "1291"}, "Description": "Please check out my other auctions to see more Hallmark ornaments listed.

Also Note that this scan generally will overstate defects.Nevertheless bid with confidence! The grades you see are extremely accurate. (Read what the buyer of a $1000.00 AF 15 recently said about our scan-nov 28 2001 feedback, or just to confirm read the Dec 3 2001 feedback of a VF Green Lantern purchase OR read what a buyer of a nm Thor said\"Pinpoint grading (an ebay rarity!) Recommend this seller.Dec 3 2001)).All grades are guarenteed within 0.5 of any grading service. The grade quoted above is an accurate grade reflecting the true condition of the book.(Any defect not revealed by the large scan will be discussed apart).The price is set so that you will be hard pressed to find as good a deal anywhere else.(This 33% bigger scan( than the books' actual size) magnifies and enlarges defects-it is like looking at the book through a magnification factor). Generally speaking the book possess's a solid intact spine with no splits;staples solidly in place;gloss and color deapth vivid,deep and close to new in appearance;only minor spine stress marks exist;overall a glossy off white to WHITE paged copy offered at an unbeatable initial bid ,with a LOW RESERVE(This low reserve allows our customers to use the buy it now feature.Many have missed out on previous books,and this feature usually prolongs the auction a bit longer to give everyone a chance to bid).As we have a large multiple grade inventory of Silver and Golden age books,many will be offered for sale in coming ads.There are many comics being auctioned off on Ebay this week.Combine auctions to save postage.THOUSANDS of other books are still to come including most Marvel and DC titles from 1960 -1972.Use the BUY IT NOW feature to end the auction and lock out the competition. We are multiple CBG award winners;EBAY Power sellers;and have 1000 total positive feedbacks(many multiple) since we began here about 2 years ago.Some may remember us for our full page Marvel adds starting in the 1980's.Our Marvel inventory is extensive and stocked in multiple conditions..Note.All our scans are \"High resolution\".That means a magnified, extremley detailed scan which is about 33% LARGER than the actual size of the comic.( so, of course, defects appear about 1/3rd bigger,than if you were viewing the item right in front of you)..Why do we do this?Why do we want the comic to have all the defects OVERSTATED? Here are the reasons; 1)All defects are CLEARLY seen.(in our opinion a small scan is of no use-the grade can be anything). 2) By revealing all defects,you can grade based upon what you like or dislike about a book. 3) No two grades have the same defects,thus a large scan allows you to delineate the key aspects of the book. 4)A large scan will OVERSTATE defects.Defects appear LARGER than what you will see when you get the book.(This applies especially to creases(thicker than actual),and stress marks,and to a lesser extent to color tones,which may show gradations in color not visible with the naked eye).Most of our customers note that the book is nicer when it arrives than what this scan revealed(reasons;the scans bright flood light reveal evey single microscopic impact point,plus defects appear 33% larger.) 5)All our books are guaranteed to be in the same general grade range(within+/- 0.5) if the book is slabbed(within 14 days of purchase) 6) Full exchange privledges on any item purchased.within 7 days. 7) Shipping : Cost; 5.00 for less than 5 comics(priority mail with delivery confirmation) in North America NOTE ;Allow 2 weeks for material to reach you;we often beat that,but increased security screening by the post office can delay shipping time;we take full responsibility.... ..Questions and/or comments?
