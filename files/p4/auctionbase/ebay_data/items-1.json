For larger items please click here to email us for a quote. All breakables and items valued near and above $50 will have insurance required. If the item is shipped via FedEx this coverage is automatic up to $100 in value, 40_ for each additional $100 coverage. For USPS delivery, $1.25 up to $50, $1.00 each additional $100. All uninsured parcels become the responsiblity of the bidder once said parcel is duly delivered to the appropriate carrier. DELIVERY CAN BE MADE WITHIN A 250 MILE RADIUS OF OUR STORE ON OUR LARGER ITEMS. PLEASE EMAIL FOR A DELIVERY QUOTE The following types of payment are accepted: money orders, personal checks*, and all major credit cards. Payment must be received within 10 business days in order to avoid negative feedback and being reported to eBay as a non-payer. This will also expedite shipping of your item. * All returned checks will be accessed a $25 service fee. Ma residents pay a 5% sales tax. SHIPPING METHODS: The bidder may at any time request the shipping service of their choice, to which will be added an appropriate handling fee. MEDIA: We have been shipping media items (records, books, etc.) by Media mail, but have experienced slow delivery times, so we are trying to move away from this service. Smaller, light-weight media items over 13 ozs. are still quoted for Media mail and the bidder may request a different delivery service. However, we WILL NOT be held responsible for the long amount of time any Media mail shipment may take. SMALLER ITEMS: Other smaller items up to 13 ozs. are shipped first class. All other items are shipped either Priority mail or FedEx. Usually anything over a few pounds is shipped via FedEx, hence the higher costs. However, their exemplary service is guarenteed, carries automatic insurance up to $100 in value, and is trackable with out additional cost. Any item shipped through the USPS Priority service without requesting additional services such as delivery confirmation can not be tracked, nor will we be held responsibility for its not being delivered (see insurance disclaimer above). LARGER ITEMS: Larger items such as furniture and such are shipped either with BAX Global or a local mover we use who makes east coast runs every two-three weeks. HANDLING FEES: Since our shipping department needs to eat (and we require him to wear shoes, please! ), and shipping materials do cost money (really!) all items have an appropriate handling fee. Basically, the more time and care taken to prepare an item for safe transport, the higher the fee. We do our best to provide both cost effective and careful handling of packaging your item. This fee is not negotiable and is usually reflected in all posted S&H charges, or added to shipping quotes for larger items.

NM 1970 ASTONISHING TALES 1 - 8 : KAZAR & DR DOOM QUESTIONS: click here to send an e-mail CONDITION : NEAR MINT OPENING BID: $9.99 HOW TO PAY? MONEY ORDER & PAYPAL HOW TO SHIP? I ship via United States Postal Service for both domestic and international. You pay only the cost required to ship. I do not believe in padding auctions by adding unjustified extra charges. I don't like it when people do it to me, so I won't do it to you. PICTURES: Click on each to get a larger view. _ #1 #7 HONESTY POLICY I have met people in my store who won books on E-Bay that were nowhere near the condition described. It angers me as a seller because it ruins the reputations of dealers as a whole. Simply put, it hurts our market by driving away customers. How Do I Grade? I look at every book and grade it according to six categories: front cover, back cover, corners, edges, spine & staples, interior pages. I give a complete description of each of these sections noting any flaws or defects. Also, I include large scans of the front and back covers. When I have completed the auction page, I am satisfied that you know exactly what you are bidding on and that there will be no surprises at auction's end. So what about returns? At first I offered returns on books. Then I quickly discovered that some people would outbid everyone else by an excessively high amount just to get a look at the book, then ask for a return if they decided they didn't want it. I no longer offer returns. I am confident in my grading and description and have never had a complaint about either. If you are not sure that you want the book then don't bid on it. COMPLETE DESCRIPTION: _ All books have come from the same collection and have received the same care over the years. Title: Astonishing Tales Featuring Kazar and Dr. Doom Issue(s) & Date(s): #1, August 1970 - #8, October 1971 Double feature books. Issues feature work by Kirby, Wood and Barry Smith.

Included are issues: 111,112,116,123,124,126,127,128,129,130,131,133,134,136,137,140,141,142,143,145,146,148,149,151,152,153,155, and #200.. Plus Incredible Hulk Special #4. All are in BEAUTIFUL condition.. really nice comics. The only exception to this would be Issue # 200 which has some dark scuffing amidst the white background. Amazing the newest one is the worst.. and even it's prob at least a Fine grade comic. I believe issue 141 is the first appearance of Doc Samson.. saw it on here for about $50 all by itself and prob not as good as this one.. It looks about perfect to me. Issues 123,124,129,130, and 131 have store date stamps on the light part of the covers.. but nothing major.. other than that they appear to be NM. It would take me forever to look at each and every page of this many comics but the few I opened and checked only showed to be a little off-white around the edges.. and near the center. Nothing out of the ordinary for a 30 year old comic. Saw no creases or any other obvious blemishes.. other than those with the store dates. All are bagged and boarded.. and rather than risk damaging them in scans I chose to scan them in the covers so if you see a little \"shimmer\" .. it's the scan... not the comic. I really don't think you'll be dissapointed in any way with the condition of these comics. If so just tell me within 3 days and I'll refund your money.. minus shipping. I think that's a fair proposition. Trying to describe these as best I can so you'll know what you're getting before you bid. I haven't researched anything as to their true value.. I'll leave it to some savy bidders to do the research and bid accordingly. I'll start the bidding at $60 which I believe is a steal for this quality and quantity. I hate to set any limits at all but I feel 2 dollars a book is a pretty good buy.Sentimentally they're worth a lot more to me.. a part of my youth I held on to for all these years. You probably can't get that many brand new comics at that price. Much less true collector items. Anyways.. that's the deal. Hope you like what you see. Will accept PayPal, Money Orders, and Cashiers Check. Shipping will be a flat 7 dollars which will include: Well packed USPS Priority Shipping, Tracking # and insurance covering the total bid price. May cost more to do all this.. will be a fairly heavy package but I lean towards the buyer when it comes to shipping charges.

Thanks :o) ~Christy~ The fine print: If for some reason, the item that you have purchased is out of stock, we will send you an email immediately upon receiving your payment informing you of the estimated shipping date. We try to ensure our inventory numbers are correct before placing an item on Ebay, Yahoo, Amazon or Ubid, but due to the fact that we use several online shopping services and also sell via our own store and webstore, sometimes we sell an item that turns out to not be in stock.

Today you can still find batik being done by the ethnic people in Guizhou Province, in the South-West of China. Here the Miao, Bouyei and Gejia people use a dye resist method that is different from the Han Chinese. The Miao place great emphasis on their costumes which are made up of decorative fabrics which they achieve by pattern weaving and wax resist. Almost all the Miao decorate hemp and cotton (not silk) by applying hot wax then dipping the cloth in an indigo dye. The cloth is then used for skirts, panels on jackets, aprons and baby carriers. Indigo is used chiefly for the basic cloth throughout Guizo to give dark blues. A paste is made from the harvested plants which have been soaked in a wooden barrel. Wax resisted fabric was probably one of the earliest forms of decoration in Guizhou as all the materials were at hand. Beeswax is the main ingredient but other resins or wax are possibly added. The wax resist never exploits crackle, the aim is to produce a clear image and beeswax is both tenacious and flexible. The wax is often heated in a little pot, resting in hot embers. Once applied the wax appears black on the fabric but at the end of the process the wax is removed from the fabric. The fabric is then rinsed in cool water and air dried. The beeswax can be reused. The usual tools for applying wax are of copper and brass with bamboo handles. They are made from 2 small triangular pieces of metal, their apexes bound to a bamboo holder by copper wire. It is held like a pen either upright or at a slant to the cloth which is laid flat on a board. This tool lends itself to the drawing of straight or slightly curving lines. The Miao, Gejia and Bouyei girls are highly skilled at batik. They use very finely drawn circular and double spiral designs representing the horns of the water buffalo, symbolising their ancestor's life and death. Girls start learning to produce batik from the age of 6 and 7 years. The finest work is found on baby carriers, sleeves of their jackets and skirts. The more traditional designs are geometric, where the most skilled wax resist reads as a fine blue line on a white ground. With the influence of the Han Chinese more figurative designs like flowers, birds, fish have been introduced over the centuries. This item is Dragon & Phoenix (3) batik.Size:45 inches long and 45 inches wide.International shipping postage is 9 US $.Combine shipping postage can be reduced.BATIK CAN ONLY BE SENT ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

However, if the buyer's feedback rating is less than 300, I will wait ten (10) business days after depositing the check before sending out the merchandise. Please note that I do not go to the bank every day (but at least once per week), so payment by personal check will result in some delay. If the winning bidder wishes, I am willing to use an approved escrow service. However, the winning bidder agrees to pay all associated charges.

Please do not email me to request that I stop an auction to sell you an item privately. It is my firm policy that once I start an auction, I will let it follow through to completion (except in unusual cases such as breakage or erroneous listing). I do not think it fair to other potential bidders to put an item up and then pull it to make a quick sale. I try to offer my merchandise at the lowest possible price without a reserve, and therefore after the auction I do not cut prices on unsold items to bidders who make me an offer. I relist them and may or may not reduce the starting price.

This group of X men are mostly warehouse copies.Also note that this scan generally will overstate defects (Read what the buyer of a $1000.00 AF 15 recently said about our scan-nov 28 2001 feedback, or just to confirm read the Dec 3 2001 feedback of a VF Green Lantern purchase OR read what a buyer of a nm Thor said\"Pinpoint grading (an ebay rarity!) Recommend this seller.Dec 3 2001)).All grades are guarenteed within 0.5 of any grading service. The grade quoted above is an accurate grade reflecting the true condition of the book.(Any defect not revealed by the large scan will be discussed apart).The price is set so that you will be hard pressed to find as good a deal anywhere else.(This 33% bigger scan( than the books' actual size) magnifies and enlarges defects-it is like looking at the book through a magnification factor). Generally speaking the book possess's a solid intact spine with no splits;staples solidly in place;corners sharp;gloss and color deapth vivid,deep and close to new in appearance;only minor spine stress marks may exist(similar to thoses produced at original printing);overall a glossy off white to WHITE paged copy offered at an unbeatable initial bid ,with a LOW RESERVE(This low reserve allows our customers to use the buy it now feature.Many have missed out on previous books,and this feature usually prolongs the auction a bit longer to give everyone a chance to bid).As we have a large multiple grade inventory of Silver and Golden age books,many will be offered for sale in coming ads.There are many comics being auctioned off on Ebay this week.Combine auctions to save postage.THOUSANDS of other books are still to come including most Marvel and DC titles from 1960 -1972.Use the BUY IT NOW feature to end the auction and lock out the competition. We are multiple CBG award winners;EBAY Power sellers;and have 1000 total positive feedbacks(many multiple) since we began here about 2 years ago.Some may remember us for our full page Marvel adds starting in the 1980's.Our Marvel inventory is extensive and stocked in multiple conditions..Note.All our scans are \"High resolution\".That means a magnified, extremley detailed scan which is about 33% LARGER than the actual size of the comic.( so, of course, defects appear about 1/3rd bigger,than if you were viewing the item right in front of you)..Why do we do this?Why do we want the comic to have all the defects OVERSTATED? Here are the reasons; 1)All defects are CLEARLY seen.(in our opinion a small scan is of no use-the grade can be anything). 2) By revealing all defects,you can grade based upon what you like or dislike about a book. 3) No two grades have the same defects,thus a large scan allows you to delineate the key aspects of the book. 4)A large scan will OVERSTATE defects.Defects appear LARGER than what you will see when you get the book.(This applies especially to creases(thicker than actual),and stress marks,and to a lesser extent to color tones,which may show gradations in color not visible with the naked eye).Most of our customers note that the book is nicer when it arrives than what this scan revealed(reasons;the scans bright flood light reveal evey single microscopic impact point,plus defects appear 33% larger.) 5)All our books are guaranteed to be in the same general grade range(within+/- 0.5) if the book is slabbed(within 14 days of purchase) 6) Full exchange privledges on any item purchased.within 7 days. 7) Shipping : Cost; 5.00 for less than 5 comics(priority mail with delivery confirmation) in North America NOTE ;Allow 2 weeks for material to reach you;we often beat that,but increased security screening by the post office can delay shipping time;we take full responsibility.... ..Questions and/or comments?

Thanks very much for looking! just in time for christmas!! This is a beauty of a set! It is the: LENOX * HANCOCK GOLD * STAINLESS 5 PIECE PLACE SETTING!! BRAND NEW SET SKU #9862092!! RETAIL $120.00! This set is BRAND NEW! and each piece is individually wrapped and comes in the manufacturers packaging and box with all paperwork as if you had purchased it in the store. Included is a SALAD FORK, PLACE FORK, PLACE KNIFE, PLACE SPOON, and TEASPOON. The scan really is not that good as I just laid them on the scanner. You really cannot see the great detail in the gold accents, but trust me, its gorgeous. All pieces are new and flawless. Any lines, markes, dots, or imperfections seen are only from the scan and NOT the pieces. Please note that all the flatwear sets I offer on EBAY are NOT \"factory seconds\" nor are they \"factory recalls\". EVERY set I sell are ORIGINAL AND AUTHENTIC and are the EXACT SAME items (same sku, model# etc..)as you would get if you purchased these in the finest stores. Because of my very low starting prices on these sets, I have had several emails inquiring about the authenticity of these settings. TRUST ME, these are the REAL DEAL, and you can verify them by taking them to any retailer to have them looked at. I have sold well over 250 premium flatwear sets in the last several months on EBAY so you can view my feedback for further assurance. I do not mean to dwell too long on this, but I know that there are alot of \"fake\" stuff offered so I just wanted to put your minds at ease. Nowback to the auction. This set sells for a minimum of $120.00 at Hetch's! Sure you may find it less than that at some warehouse type outlets, but I guarantee you won't find it cheaper than here! This is a very beautiful design and made by one of the BEST manufacturers of flatwear sets. Minimum is only $19.99 which is ridiculous. Someone will be very happy with this set. You should always have extra settings for unexpected guests, and this is an excellent and affordable way to obtain one without spending mucho money! Please view my flawless 600+ feedback and know that I am an honest and reputable seller. A lot of flatwear on EBAY are advertised as \"new condition\" but in reality has been in the seller's possession for quite some time. All my items are BRAND NEW and AUTHENTIC!! I HAVE 4 TOTAL SETS OF THIS PATTERN UP NOW ON EBAY IN CASE YOU NEED MORE! I also have other premium sets curretly up on EBAY, so please check them out. This item will be sent via Priority Mail for $4.50. Additional settings won, please add $1 per setting for combined S/H. Insurance extra if desired, although I have never had a problem with lost or damaged mail by Priority Mail. But it's your choice. I accept PayPal, checks, and MOs.
