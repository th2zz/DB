Written by Julie Taymor with Alexis Greene and published by Hyperion in October 1997. This book is new, not used. 192 pages, FIRST EDITION, hardback with dust jacket. Excellent condition with only slight rubbing and surface wear to the dust jacket from shipping and storage. 10 x 11 inches. Winner of six Tony Awards including Best Musical & Best Director. The Broadway adaptation of the remarkably successful film The Lion King is a stunning musical directed by Tony Award-nominated director Julie Taymor. In The Lion King: Pride Rock on Broadway, Taymor takes readers on a revealing journey. From the earliest sketches of costume concepts and set design to the trials and tribulations of mounting one of the most complex Broadway musicals in history, this lavishly illustrated volume allows readers an intimate perspective on the long road to opening night. Known for her singular style as a director and designer of striking costumes, masks, and puppets, Taymor's vision for The Lion King emphasizes the duality of human and animal. Remarkably detailed fabrics, carved masks, and extraordinary makeup bring the characters vibrantly to life. Exquisite sets depict the African savanna, an elephant graveyard, and Pride Rock. Taymor and her co-designer, Michael Curry, showcase the mechanics of the production, its stylized imagery, and distinctive puppetry. As the audience experiences the many scenes - gazelles leaping across the stage, thousands of wildebeest stampeding through the canyon, Timon hanging precariously above a waterfall - they become a part of the magic of theater.

Non-paying bidder alerts filed 10 days after auction end without receipt of payment and credit requests with appropriate feedback left after 20 days of auction end with no payment received. 4.

It is a size L and it measures 40 inches in the bust, 38 inches in the waist, 52 inches in the hips and it is 54 inches long. This is meant to fit loosely so it flows like silk when you walk. ENJOY! Please read before bidding ( esp. the stuff in red! ): The pics speak for themselves in this case. It may take a moment to load, but stick around because it's worth it! Please note, all measurements and available tag sizes are included, please be sure to know your size. We cannot be responsible for items that do not fit you, as we do not know your measurements. We have included several images so please be patient. Check our other auctions for even more wild vintage clothing. We carry swing, mod, hippie, rockabilly, lounge, swank, rave, gothic... if you can name it, chances are we've got it! As with all vintage clothes, some wear is to be expected.

Bid with confidence- check our feedback! Feel free to email if you have any questions, we re here to help. And don't forget, kids: T-Bone takes Pay Pal! Due to the high cost of international shipping, if you are a non-US bidder we are forced to require a US Money Order (or good old Pay Pal!) and we must re-calculate the shipping prior to payment. US shipping will be $5.00. We can no longer ship any other way than USPS Priority within the US. Priority mail allows for delivery confirmation (which really covers both the seller AND the buyer). Because we must rely on delivery confirmation for verification, we cannot deviate from this policy. This auction is for serious bidders only. Please do not bid on this item if funds are not available for immediate payment. People with overwhelmingly negative feedback are asked not to bid. We will remove these negative bidders from our auctions at our discretion. If payment is not received within ten days from end of auction bidders will be given a negative feedback, be reported to eBay as deadbeat bidder and be removed from any of our auctions.

Please read before bidding ( esp. the stuff in red! ): The pics speak for themselves in this case. It may take a moment to load, but stick around because it's worth it! Please note, all measurements and available tag sizes are included, please be sure to know your size. We cannot be responsible for items that do not fit you, as we do not know your measurements.

We carry swing, mod, hippie, rockabilly, lounge, swank, rave, gothic... if you can name it, chances are we've got it! As with all vintage clothes, some wear is to be expected.

Bid with confidence- check our feedback! Feel free to email if you have any questions, we re here to help. And don't forget, kids: T-Bone takes Pay Pal! Due to the high cost of international shipping, if you are a non-US bidder we are forced to require a US Money Order (or good old Pay Pal!) and we must re-calculate the shipping prior to payment. US shipping will be $5.00. We can no longer ship any other way than USPS Priority within the US. Priority mail allows for delivery confirmation (which really covers both the seller AND the buyer). Because we must rely on delivery confirmation for verification, we cannot deviate from this policy. This auction is for serious bidders only. Please do not bid on this item if funds are not available for immediate payment. People with overwhelmingly negative feedback are asked not to bid. We will remove these negative bidders from our auctions at our discretion. If payment is not received within ten days from end of auction bidders will be given a negative feedback, be reported to eBay as deadbeat bidder and be removed from any of our auctions.

This tablecloth is sold \"as found\". There are no tears, snags or damage, but this set must be cleaned.

Unless noted otherwise, all items I offer are used, vintage, etc. All sales are final. Condition of items vary and I do my best to point out flaws when I see them, but \"perfect\" or \"flawless\" are in the eyes of the beholder. NOTE: In most cases, textiles such as tablecloths, fabrics, doilies, etc are NOT cleaned by me. Most vintage textiles may have light soil, dust, etc. and should be cleaned by the buyer, as most buyers of textiles have their own favorite techniques and preferences. I make no claims of expertise in any of the items that I sell. While it is my responsibility to describe the item I have up for bids as accurately as possible, it is YOUR responsibility to READ that description. Please do not make assumptions regarding an item.

Please view our other auctions for more great stuff!___________________________________: This is translated from a foreign site, so please excuse the syntax and spelling::: Mayoria of the people when listening swastica immediately relates it to Hitler, nazism, but in fact this he is not simbolo of Nazi invention, the swastica has old origins. Their roots, according to some books of history, overcome it to the Era of Bronze. The word Swastica or Cruz Gamada, as some call to him, is derived from \"the svastica\" sanscrito that ignifica s \"well-being\". It was used in the antiguedad like simbolo of prosperity and good fortune, simbolo of peace and alegria. It has been used in the primitive currencies of the old Mesopotamia, by the Egyptians like representation of the power that each human being has in himself, has been used in the buddhism, also used like decoration, amulet and talisman. This simbolo habia used in all the continents, except in Australia, before Hitler chose it like simbolo Nazi. Two types of swasticas exist, the one that turns in opposite direction of the small hands of the clock, that is sauvastika; and the one that turns in direction of the small hands of the clock (the Hakenkreuz), this was the used one by the Nazis, usually is considered like simbolo to pave. The swastica usually represents the night and is used often in magical practices. This symbol, was the maximum sign of the Divinity, as it is it today the Cross for the Christians. The Nazi party decidio to use this simbolo like flag of its party in the year of 1919, and was when volume great height and by more than fifty years the Nazism of Hitler has followed alive in the sw_stica. The Nazi connotation that nowadays has the sw_stica is so strong that it cannot be forgotten. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

What you are bidding on is, a very nice sign, that no bar, or game room should be without. It has a very nice etched wood frame, and the sign is not paper. The sign is printed on the back of the glass, like a liqoure mirror. It is an advertisement for Old Sunny Brook Kentuckey Whiskey, and it looks great hanging on any wall. I dont know how old this is, but I have had it for a very long time. It is in very good condition, and it measures 13 1/4\" wide, and 8 3/4\" tall. I would guess that this is from the 50s or 60s, but I am not sure. This would make an exellent addition to any game room, or bar, and it would make a great christmas gift. Buyer pays $5.20 shipping. I have other liqoure oriented items. Just click \"view sellers other auctions\" and see There will be an extra $1.10 charge to be insured and I am not responsible for uninsured items.

We ship via UPS or the Postal Service and are not responsible for uninsured items shipped via the Postal Service that are lost or damaged. We recommend to those of you that have your packages shipped via the Postal Service that you purchase Postal Delivery Confirmation (.40-$1.50) but we will not include this charge unless asked. This is the only method the Postal Service has of tracking your package. If you do not purchase this all we can tell you is the date your package was shipped.

If you plan on purchasing more than one item and wish to consolidate shipping do not use the \"checkout\" option which appears after an auction closes. Please note that the selvage may have one small hole every yard. The selvage is usually a narrow strip of fabric that runs along both sides of the material and is not used for upholstering. These small holes will in no way effect the use of the fabric. The holes are a result of the way that we sometimes measure short pieces. Please ask any questions you might have about the item BEFORE you bid. If you have any reservations please do not bid as all sales are final. At auctions end we will send the winning bidder an email asking for their address so that we can calculate shipping charges. Due to space limitations we will only consolidate up to ten days worth of winning bids. The ten days begin after the first piece that you win closes. Unfortunately there are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule as we are operating out of a small space and simply do not have the room to consolidate indefinitely. If you do wish to consolidate it is your responsibility to keep track of what you have won. If payment is not received within 2 weeks from end of auction we reserve the right to relist item and leave negative feedback. DO NOT BID IF YOU DON'T PLAN ON PAYING IN A TIMELY MANNER!
