This wondrous machine is able to read a person's thought processes and translate these to videotape.

Whether you are a beginning or advanced guitarist, you will benefit from Fred Hand's in-depth explorationof the fundamental principles of classical guitar technique. \"Your body and mind have an innate ability to express the music that you hear,\" says Hand, \"you only need to tap into this source.\" By learning the essentials of good playing, such as posture, relaxation, fingernail shaping and the correct application of the free stroke and rest stroke, you will quickly become a smoother and more efficient player. As you practice your arpeggios, scales, vibrato, trills and cross-string trills, you'll learn to apply them to beautiful classical-style pieces such as John Dowland's \"Lady Hunnsden's Puffe\" and a dance by Gaspar Sanz. Hand's own compositions, \"A Celtic Tale,\" \"Heartsong \" and \"Lesley's Song\" are perfect examples of the application of classical techniques to pieces in a contemporary setting. This is a lesson that will dramatically improve the playing of both classical musicians and fingerstyle guitarists of other tradition. About Frederic Frederick Hand's 30-year recording, composing and touring career has garnered rave reviews from critics throughout the world. He has performed with Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, Zubin Mehta, Pierre Boulez, The Waverly Consort, Mostly Mozart Orchestra and his own ensemble, Jazzantiqua. He arranged and performed the theme from Academy Award-winning film \"Kramer Vs. Kramer,\" which led to best-selling recordings \"Baroque and On The Street\" (Sony) and \"Jazzantiqua\" (Musicmasters/BMG). Mr. Hand is currently on the faculty of Mannes College of Music and has given masterclasses at the New England Conservatory, Boston Conservatory, Yale University and Emory University. His compositions are published and recorded around the world. He is the 1996 Emmy-award winning composer for \"The Guiding Light.\" The New York Times wrote, \"He played unerringly, with all the verve and spirit that one could ask,\" while the Milwaulkee Sentinel called Hand \"A brilliant master of the guitar.\" 75 Minute VHS Video, In Gently Used Condition.

Never Viewed! Call of the Wild, Jack London's classic story of a young man's adventure in the Yukon, is transformed into a breathtaking, action packed film starring Lonesome Dove's Rick Schroder and Mia Sara (Ferris Bueller's Day Off). Shot on location in the rustic wilderness of British Columbia, it's an exciting film the whole family will enjoy. It's 1897 and young John Thorton feels the need to break free from his father's overbearing grip. John jumps a steamer north to join the frenzied fever of the Yukon Gold Rush. But \"the call of the wild\" is not the place pictured in his romantic dreams. Harsh weather, unforgiving terrain, hostile Indians and cutthroat miners remind him he is far from home. John Thorton is struggling for survival, but he has three good reasons to stay alive: Charlie, a wise Indian who becomes his friend and teacher, Sue, the first true love of his life, and Buck the courageous dog who helps show him the true meaning of life. Together they will share joy and sorrow in an unforgetable adventure of discovery. A real classic. DVD DETAILS: Rated G; 97 minutes; Color; Coded Region 1 (US and Canada).

It is identical to the first printing done by the studio. Only an appraiser could probably tell the difference. Now, as far as collectability goes, to give you an example - First printings for BARBARELLA posters sell for a few hundred dollars (if you can even find one). The studio realized that this was not appropriate for the average person who wanted the poster for their wall and so they went back and re-issued the poster in mass quantity and so the value of the re-issues is not like the first printings, yet you get basically the same quality. This provides an affordable alternative for someone to obtain a poster for a movie like BARBARELLA. Again, this is NOT a poster-house reprint. Those are photocopies of the originals and the quality is not nearly as good. I offer a complete satisfaction guarantee on all my products!!! SHIPPING INFORMATION: Products will ship within 1-2 business days of receipt of payment via USPS Priority Mail unless otherwise requested (additional charges may apply to special shipping requests). A shipping charge in the amount of $4.65 ($6.35 for 2-4 posters; $7.95 5 or more posters) must be added to final bid price for Continental U.S. shipping (Foreign shipments will be billed at actual shipping costs - Please e-mail me prior to the auction closing for specific rates).

Bill Murray NEW, UNOPENED, FACTORY SEALED! DVD After the stiff attempts at realism in many recent features, it's a treat to see broad cartoon-style animation on the big screen in Osmosis Jones, a spoof of cop movies set inside the human body. The title character (voice by Chris Rock) is a street-smart white blood cell, working for Frank's immune system. He and Drix (David Hyde Pierce), an over-the-counter cold capsule, are reluctant partners fighting what appears to be a minor infection. Osmosis discovers Frank has really contracted a fatal virus, Thrax (Laurence Fishburne): he battles a corrupt body politic led by a venal mayor (William Shatner) to save Frank's life and win the affection of the mayor's aide, Leah (Brandy Norwood). Rock's motor-mouth delivery can get annoying, but it contrasts nicely with straight arrow Drix (imagine a fussy Buzz Lightyear). Excellent drawing and a powerful vocal performance make Thrax a genuinely frightening villain. DVD Features: Regional Code: Region .1 Layers: Dual Audio Tracks: English 5.1, French 5.1, Spanish 2.0 DTS Audio Tracks: none Subtitles: French, Closed-captioned: Yes Ratios: Widescreen No A/R, Anamorphic Special Features: Under the Microscope - Behind the Scenes Commentary By Director, Writers, Producers including Farrelly Bros.

Patricia Arquette stars as Kristen, whose nightmare leads to a slashed wrist which looks suspiciously like a suicide attempt. She is placed in a hospital psychiatric ward with a group of six other troubled teens, who all dream about the same horribly burned man, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) trying to kill them. Perhaps the most unusual thing about this picture, however, is the unexpected depth of sadness running through it. There are some achingly sweet moments in this otherwise frightening film which, though not disruptive, are impossible to analyze. The first and most bizarre of these is the entrance of dream researcher Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), which inexplicably causes most viewers to get misty-eyed, and there are several similar scenes throughout the film. One answer can be found in the sensitive direction of Chuck Russell, who emphasizes the tragedy and utter hopelessness in these kids' lives and manages to wring some unexpectedly perceptive turns from his cast. This is a film in which a great deal of care was obviously lavished on individual scenes (the sets are outstanding) and performances. The results are well worth repeated viewings, and prove that sequels don't necessarily have to be inferior films. This video is previously viewed but from a private collection in its original box. The box has some wear but overall is in good condition. The tape is in excellent condition.

The training is meant to prepare the young men for a series of 36 tests that must eventually be passed, the last being the fiercely challenging and usually fatal test of the 18 Bronzemen. After twenty years of devotion, the time at last comes to take on the 36 tests. Only by passing the tests can Shao Lung meet his destiny.

Cohan & MORE! I came into a huge collection of THE THEATRE magazines this weekend - circa 1900 to 1918. A lot of them have great articles, great pics of the great theatrical people of that time, and lots of wonderful ads - some black & white and some color. So from this wonderful collection of paper I am offering: A complete June 1914 issue of THE THEATRE. I can't even begin to tell you what you get inside but I will detail some of the highlights: A very nice FRAMEABLE cover (light carboard) of MISS LAURETTE TAYLOR in \"Peg O' My Heart\"; a back cover (light cardboard) color page for PACKARD; black and white ads for Lord & Taylor (\"Onyx Hosiery\"); Columbia Graphophone Co (endorsed by Vernon Castle); Good Year; Wilcox & White Co Pianos; Victrola; Burgesser Hats; Lucky Strike Cigarettes; Speedway Runabout; BVD; Riz La Famous Cigarette Papers; Egyptian Deities Cigarettes; Violet Sec Toilet Water. Color ad (inside back cover) for MURAD Cigarettes. B&W pictures/articles of Ethel Barrymore, Marie Nordstrom, Marie Wallace, Flo Hart, Bessie Gross, Lydia Lopokova, Inez Plummer, Margaret Anglin, Cecil Kern, Eva Davenport, Grace George, Lois Meredith, Ann Swinburne, Grace Valentine, Lawrence Dorsay, Robert Mantell, Vivian Rushmore, Julia Marlow, Frances Starr, Vera Finley. Articles include WHAT THE AMERICAN FLAG HAS DONE FOR ME by George M. Cohan, BILLIE BURKE in Her Home, WHAT IS A JEUVENILE LEAD? by JOHN BARRYMORE. The cover is frameable - nicks at the edges, a few small cuts at the edges, wear on the spine but for something almost 100 years old, I think you will forgive the small stuff! What you see is what you get - I used the digital camera to take the pics cause my scanner wouldn't take in the whole print. The pages of the magazine measure 10\" x 14\". GORGEOUS SUBDUED COLOR! (look for other fabulous paper I have up in other categories!) NO RESERVE AFTER OPENING BID!! Winning bidder to pay for priority shipping (the reason for this is the cardboard the USPO provides makes sure that you get this item in perfect condition as it as so large).

Directed by George Sydney. Based on Elvis Presley's decision to join the army at the height of his popularity, this 1963 film introduces rock 'n' roller Conrad Birdie (Jesse Pearson) just before he's off to boot camp. But first, he has to say goodbye to his adoring fans, especially to the beautiful Kim McAfee (Ann-Margaret), who runs a fan club nearby. Suddenly all the kids in town are bucking authority and having far too much fun - which naturally makes the adults nervous. Bye Bye Birdie is a wild romp about the birth of rock and roll and all the change it brought with it. Ann-Margaret's songs are sexy enough to compete with anything Madonna's done on film, while Dick Van Dyke's portrayal of a smooth-talkin' PR man is an eerie look at the direction show biz would take.

IMPORTANT IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO INSURE: I am not responsible and do not provide refunds for items lost in the mail or stolen after delivery. ALSO: During shipping, DVD_s can shake loose from the retaining spindle inside their keep-boxes. The disc can receive slight scratches (but probably will still play perfectly), but I do not provide returns or refunds if this happens.

There is no conventional dialogue to progress the narrative. Our story is about Pink, a rock and roll performer, who sits locked in a hotel room, somewhere in Los Angeles. Too many shows, too much dope, too much applause: a burned out case. On the TV, an all-too-familiar war film flickers on the screen. We shuffle time and place, reality and nightmare, as we venture into Pink's painful memories, each one a 'brick' in the wall he has gradually built around his feelings. Slowly he withdraws from the real world and slips further into his nightmare as he imagines himself as an unfeeling demagogue, for whom all that is left is the demonstration of power over his unthinking audience, the culmination of the odious excess of his own world and the world around him. His internal self trial follows, as the witnesses of his past life, the very people who have contributed to the building of the wall, come forward and testify against him. --Alan Parker Pink Floyd The Wall: Deluxe DVD Edition features: New Hi-Definition film transfer from the original widescreen interpositive.

You are bidding on a BRAND NEW(factory sealed) VHS video of JAZZ SCENE 1962 USA's broadcast of STAN KENTON and FRANK ROSOLINO. This nationally syndicated television program, the brainchild of life-long jazz devotee Steve Allen, was a series which showcases many jazz performers. Uncompromising in its use of imaginative camera angles, the visual style is on par with the creativity of the music. These shows are time capsules to treasure from America's golden age of television. FRANK ROSOLINO (1926-1978) was quite simply one of the most brilliant trombone stylists in jazz history. His exceptional technique and exuberant personality sent bolts of intensity through every solo. After extensive experience in the big bands of Bob Chester, Glen Gray, Gene Krupa, with whom he recorded and filmed the delightful Lemon Drop, Tony Pastor, Herbie Fields and Stan Kenton, plus the wonderful 1951 Georgie Auld Quartet, he settled in Los Angeles in 1954. It wasn't long before ROSOLINO was trombonist numero uno on the West Coast, working regularly with the Lighthouse All Stars, and frequently getting calls for record, film and TV studio work. His rhythm section on this broadcast included a young Mike Melvoin on piano, bassist Bob Bertaux, and drummer Nick Martinis. The set consists mostly of standards: Yesterdays (at an unusually fast tempo) Mean To Me Please Don't Bug Me Lover Man and Thelonious Monk's Well You Needn't The stature of STAN KENTON (1912-1979) in the pantheon of big band jazz remains unchallenged to this day, more than fifty years after he made his first waves in the early 1940's. Committed to music education and the nurturing of young talent, through his band's ranks passed many of modern jazz's most compelling performers, including Art Pepper, Stan Getz, Shelly Manne, Maynard Ferguson, Anita O'Day, June Christy, Lee Konitz, Frank Rosolino, Conte Condoli, and Mel Lewis, to name just a few. Kenton's controversial emphasis on composition in the jazz idiom encouraged the work of such writers as Pete Rugolo, Bill Russo, Gerry Mulligan and Shorty Rogers. Marvin Stamm is on trumpet, Don Menza on tenor, and Bob Fitzpatrick on trombone are featured here along with Kenton performing: Limehouse Blues All The Things You Are Waltz of the Prophets Maria Malaguena The video is 60 minutes in length, recorded in SP Mode/RealTime. Winning bidder (Other than the \"BUY IT NOW\" winner) to pay an additional $2.50 for Media Mail, $3.50 for First Class Mail OR $4.50 for Priority Mail in the US. Optional insurance is available @ $1.10 per item. Also, with the holiday season upon us, we will gift wrap and send your package to a third person as a gift. Fees apply.

Set in the American South, a small town. From the play Valentine's Day by Horton Foote . A prequel to Horton Foote's 1918 (released in 1985) On Valentine's Day was filmed in 1984, then held back from release till 1986. On the titular day, Elizabeth Vaughn ( Hallie Foote, Horton's daughter) and Horace Robedeaux ( William Converse-Roberts ) elope. Horace stubbornly refuses to ask for financial assistance from his parents or in-laws, so the penniless couple is compelled to live in an inexpensive boarding house. Their fellow tenants are the usual assortment of eccentrics, including alcoholic Bobby Pate ( Richard Jenkins ), spinster Miss Ruth ( Carol Goodheart ), heartbroken George Tyler ( Steven Hill ) and garrulous young Bessie ( Jeanne McCarthy ). After several months of enduring the woes of the other boarders, Horace swallows his pride and agrees to allow father-in-law Michael Higgins to support him and Elizabeth . There's a reconciliation, but one tinged with the premonition that Horace and Elizabeth aren't out of the woods yet. Together with Portrait of a Marriage (never released theatrically), On Valentine's Day and 1918 were later reedited and incorporated into a Horton Foote TV trilogy on the PBS network. Director Ken Harrison . Starring: William Converse-Roberts, Hallie Foote, Michael Higgins, Steven Hill, Richard Jenkins, Carol Goodheart, Jeanne McCarthy, Matthew Broderick . Explicit Language, Adult Situations, Questionable for Children. Produced by American Playhouse / Angelika Films / Guadalupe / Hudson / Lumiere Prods. 1984. Running time: 106 min. Made for TV.

This tape comes from my personal collection and has only been watched a couple of times. Both box and tape are in near excellent condition. The wild imaginations of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez team up for an over-the-top blast combination of vampires and gangsters that has become a cult legend. Tarantino and George Clooney are convict brothers on the run who take Harvey Keitel and his family, including daughter Juliette Lewis hostage. They go to a Mexican truck stop for a meet that turns into a nightmare when it turns out that the employees of the bar are all a bunch of vampires. Soon, there's only a handful of humans left. The action and gore are nearly nonstop, and the film plays much better in the widescreen mode. Look for Salma Hayek as a sexy vampire, along with Fred Hammer Williamson, special effects whiz Tom Savini and Cheech Marin (playing three different characters) in supporting roles.

Quality Collectibles Since 2000! Just in time for Christmas_here are several neat movie-related items from M_xico! They will make someone very happy Christmas morning! Happy Holidays, and God bless. Take a look at our new website! Link below! Mexican lobby cards are larger (12.50 x 16.75) and often more colorful and action-packed than other lobbies. They usually come in a set of eight, with brightly colored artwork and a black and white inset photo which varies from card to card. These are actual, theater used posters. They come from a collector friend whose mother-in-law worked for a film distributor in M_xico City. She saved the ones she liked, and stored them carefully. They are a historical treasure today! Here's a wonderful Jane Powell item! It's a mini poster from Mexico, probably meant to be a calendar top, with Jane all dalmationed out. A good size 11.74 x 14.5 inches. Sweet and a bit campy--Jane looks great! Take a look at all my auctions--where else but at Mexican Memorabilia can you consistently find such a high percentage of unusual, quality collectibles you never see anywhere else?

Take a look at our BRAND NEW Mexican Memorabilia web site! Most Mexican houses have no attic, so things like movie memorabilia and ephemera rarely get saved!

Lobby cards, movie-related displays and promotions? Advertisements? We've got all kinds of stuff, from the teens to the 60's. Speaking of all kinds of stuff--if you haven_t been to Bruce Hershenson_s, you are really missing out! Bruce has an incredible movie poster site, sells hundreds and hundreds of posters a week at auction, and hosts a movie poster e-mail club that is absolutely the best way to keep up with the hobby!

Plastic been removed. Starring Lucille Ball, Beatrice Arthur, Bruce Davison, Joyce Van Patten, Kirby Furlong and Robert Preston. She throws parties for every occasion- or nonoccasion- that comes to mind. Circles the globe and files high on cardboard moons. Gallops to victory in a fox hunt the first time she ever mounts a horse. She's Mame Dennis, one of the most beloved stage and screen characters of the last 30 years. And Mame, the 1974 film edition of the 1966 Broadway musical smash, is the latest- and most glittering- appearance of the madcap for whom \" life is a banquet. \" Playing Mame is another well-loved lady. In her final theatrical film, the late Lucille Ball invested Mame with the glamour that inspired photography experts to dub her \" Technicolor Tessie \" for her alluring blues eyes and gorgeous, open face. A former Goldwyn Girl from early movie musicals, Lucy's right in step with a high-kicking chorus and right on target with punchliness and pratfalls. On hand from New York original are TV Golden Girl Beatrice Arthur, delightfully reprising her Tony Award-winning role as venomously vampy Vera Charles; Jane Connell as the ever-befuddled governess Agnes Gooch; and two of Broadway's best magic-makers: chorographer Onna White and the three-time Tony-winning director Gene Saks. Joining the club as Mame's husband Beauregard, The Music Man's Robert Preston sings the liting \" Loving You, \" written especially for the film by Jerry Herman ( Hello, Dolly! La Cage aux Folles ). His tunes for Mame, from the uptempo \" It's Today \" and \" We Need a Little Christmas \" to pensive \" My Best Girl \" and \" If He Walked into My Life, \" rank among Broadway's best. So light the candles, get the ice out, roll the rug up. And be sure to invite Mame. We do NOT participate in any credit card or pay through programs.

This is a Blockbuster Previewed Movie and it is in very good condition. MOVIE Homeboy Alternate Title: Los Angeles de Carlitos -- Release Year: 1988 Cast: Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken, Debra Feuer, Thomas Quinn, Kevin Conway, Anthony Alda Director: Michael Seresin Categories: Drama Rated: R (Violence, Brief Nudity, Adult Situations, Questionable for Children, Explicit Language, Profanity ) Running Time: 118 minutes SYNOPSIS Johnny Walker (Mickey Roarke) is a punch-drunk and alcoholic cowboy pugilist who gives boxing one last shot in Asbury Park, New Jersey. He meets Wesley Pendergrass (Christopher Walken), the smooth-talking hood who tries to talk Johnny into helping in the heist of a jewelry store. Johnny considers the offer but elects to enter the ring to help Ruby (Debra Feuer) and her financially troubled arcade with the prize money. He agrees to the bout despite the fact that a blow to his fractured temple bone could kill him. Plodding, pretentious, and cliche-ridden, Walken's performance is the highlight of this grim film. Roarke sued to stop the release of the feature, claiming that the money and creative control promised to him was never delivered. Music is provided by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen. ~ Dan Pavlides, All Movie Guide Buy now and get your Items by Christmas.... *** TERMS*** *Please direct all questions to smrtdsgn1@aol.com *Shipping is set at $5.00 and I'm sorry but I am unable to give multiple item shipping discounts at this time.
