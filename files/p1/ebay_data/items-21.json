The item measures approximately 8 x 11 inches. As a free bonus to bidders I will include 14 episodes (on 7 tapes) of this short-lived series on VHS (see photo of one sheet and episode descriptions below). The episodes were taped in SP mode with a 4 Head Hifi VCR and the quality is above average. SHOW SYNOPSIS: The Marshal debuted on ABC TV's primetime line-up Tuesday, January 31, 1995 bringing with it a cinematic sensibility removed from the conventions of the small-screen. A much-anticipated second-season transfusion to a formulaic action genre, this critically acclaimed contemporary crime drama starred able film-and-TV veteran Jeff Fahey as Deputy United States Marshal Winston MacBride, an unorthodox fugitive retrieval specialist with a well-earned reputation for tenacity and resourcefulness. MacBride's easy-going outward demeanor and self-effacing affability belied a hidden focus and dedication to a dangerous complex job. To an analytical postal inspector working with him on a particularly convoluted case, he once offered: \"I usually just chase people.\" Possessing an overwhelming sense of fairness, he was quick to make difficult decisions based not necessarily upon the obvious thing to do but rather upon his estimation of the right thing to do. While more than unpredictable in his methods, he was no loose cannon. He may have tested the tensile strength of the rules from time to time but actually broke them only on the rarest of occasions. MacBride favored guile over gunplay and to the chagrin of fellow law-enforcers more often than not displayed open admiration of his more elusive quarry for their craftiness in their efforts to elude him. He was a family man. Dedicated husband to a bright career woman and loving father of two young daughters. Yet, despite his obvious devotion to them, he seemed strangely comfortable in the role of the solitary hunter during extended assignments. This apparent dichotomy set Winston MacBride apart from the character-type one might expect expect to see in an action lead. In the noir-bizarre episode, Love Is Strange, after briefly studying a sample of his handwriting, a consulting graphologist makes her skills evident to The Marshal by observing: \"You don't swim with the other ducks, do you?\" Extremely well-written female characters, allies and adversaries alike, were a staple of the series. The women of the episodes Hitwoman, Protection, Snow Orchid, Love Is Strange and Kissing Cousins stand out as key examples. But beyond these there are others who as well reflect a dimensionality as much exciting as reaffirming. The overall tone of The Marshal broke convention in a very clever way. Always refreshingly inventive, the show's stylishly subtle quirkiness branded it unique among the dramatic network offerings of the day. A bittersweet holiday gift to die-hard fans, the final episode (co-written by Ben Stein who also appeared in a supporting role) aired December 25, 1995. Its title proved prophetic and more than fittingly ironic: Time Off for Clever Behavior. Cast Information: Jeff Fahey .... Winston MacBride Patti Harras .... Sally McBride Brion James ....

On the surface, Jack Lawrence (Billy Crystal) and Dale Putley (Robin Williams) wouldn't appear to have much in common. Jack is an efficient, serious-minded lawyer with a successful practice and a beautiful wife, Carrie (Julia-Louis Dreyfus). Dale is a very single performance artist given to dramatic mood swings and extreme overreaction to the sad state of his career. However, 17 years ago both men were involved with the same woman, Collette Andrews (Nastassja Kinski); she later had a son, Scott (Charlie Hofheimer), without being sure if Jack or Dale was actually the father. Collette chose to raise the boy on her own, but when Scott runs away from home and she can't track him down, she calls both Jack and Dale looking for help. It doesn't take long for the two men to discover that they're both looking for the same boy in the same places, and they decide to join forces, though their personalities don't get much more compatible the longer they hunt for Scott.

King takes you on a journey through some of LANOIS' production work with U2, Bob Dylan, Peter Gabriel, The Neville Brothers and the making of LANOIS'S \"For The Beauty of Wynonna\" CD. This item is what Lanois calls a _series of musical snapshots that we pulled together during a six month adventure._ This item is no longer commercially available, and is OUT OF PRINT. Music performed including: Elle Est Bonne Et Belle/O Marie/Le Petit Cordonier- w/ Roland and Real Charette/Indian Red-w/ Daryl Johnson, and Bill Dillon/With God On Our Side-w/Aaron Neville/Series Of Dreams w/Bob Dylan/ The Collection of Marie Claire/Fisherman_s Daughter Instrumental/ I Still Haven_t Found What I_m Looking For w/U2/The Messenger/Come Talk To Me w/Peter Gabriel/Need Somebody/Bother LA w/ Daryl Johnson and Ronald Jones/For The Beauty Of Wynona/Waiting/Rocky World This item is a previously pre-viewed video (PPV), and is in like new condition, with very good to excellent viewing quality.

Only a tiny remnant of humanity survives, huddled in small enclaves across the continents. The Fukai, a thick jungle whose spores and plantlife are poisonous to humans, covers much of the Earth $B!#%L (Bs surface. Feeding on the pollutants of the former human civilization, the Fukai continues to expand, enveloping the outposts of mankind and consuming them. Giant mutated insects are now the dominant form of life, living both in and above the Fukai. Of these, the Ohmu reign supreme -- seventy-meter long pillbug-shaped guardians of the Fukai. One of these islands of humanity is known as the Valley of the Wind. Protected from the spores by strong winds from the sea, these winds also power a forest of windmills to perform work and pump water from underground wells. Nonetheless, the inhabitants of the Valley must still be vigilant to ensure that the fungi do not gain a foothold amongst their crops and water supply. This story follows Nausicaa, the headstrong yet kindhearted princess of the Valley of Wind, as she strives to understand the mysteries of the Fukai and protect her Valley in the midst of this war-torn world.

We DO ask that you respond in 3 days to our email so we know you are alive (if you were abducted by aliens, we'll allow another 24 hours but we may want a validated photo of the inside of the \"mother ship\" ). We are normally VERY FAST at sending you an email immediately after the auction closes. If you do not respond to our email in 7 days, you have VOIDED the sale and a Non-Paying Bidder report will be filed with eBay If you don't receive our email - which many people like but some people think is too long and \"wordy\" - (actually, as is this \"small print section\") - within 12 hours after an auction closes, EMAIL us! Please do not use Ebay's checkout to contact us unless all else fails. eBay will not allow us to \"opt out\" of Checkout but we do not use it since it will slow down processing of YOUR ORDER.

In the late 1950's and 1960's a motley crew of independent film producers pumped up double bills with sinister mayhem and horror. Whether the venue was a run-down movie palace, a musty neighborhood theatre or a drive-in under the stars, kids, teenagers on dates, and outcasts found themselves receptive to the promise of witnessing the unveiling of macabre secrets, nearly forbidden, it seemed, because of the bloody gruesomeness of lascivious sexuality hinted at by the colorful posters and ballyhoo. For the young, horror films were a psychic, if bizarre glimpse into the still-mysterious world of adulthood; for the rest of the audience, these films provided a jolting break from the predictable and the mundane. Beast From Haunted Cave Released: 1959 Director: Monte Hellman Cast: Michael Forest, Sheila Carol, Frank Wolff, Richard Sinatra, Wally Campo Running Time: 75 mins. Gold thieves hiding in a wilderness cabin encounter a spider-like monster. The Beast from Haunted Cave owes its existence to a World War II action film about German Paratroopers. Producer/ Director Roger Corman was making plans to film Ski Troop Attack in the winter wonderland of the Black Hills of South Dakota and, in order to get the most product bang out of his limited budget buck, decided to produce with brother Gene, another film at the same time, utilizing much of the same cast and crew. Screenwriter Chuck Griffith received an assignment from Corman to come up with a scrip that copied their previous Naked Paradise (1957), this time substituting a blizzard for a storm. Corman added: \"Oh, and add a monster.\" The Brain That Wouldn't Die Released: 1962 Director: Joseph Green Cast: Jason Evers, Virginia Leith, Leslie Daniels, Adele Lamont Running Time: 82 mins. A brilliant surgeon keeps the decapitated head of his fianc e alive after an auto accident while he searches for a suitably stacked body into which to transplant the head. Thirteen days is all it took director Joseph Green to make this wild and sleazy tale that became an undisputed cult classic that no true lover of trash cinema can afford to miss.

Anne of Green Gables Complete 6 VHS Set Starring: Megan Follows Jonathan Crombie Colleen Dewhurst Rated: Not Rated Running Time: 630 minutes total NTSC format (US and Canada only) Color, 3 Box sets, NTSC Number of tapes: 6 Anne of Green Gables Kevin Sullivan's \"Anne of Green Gables\" is the definitive screen adaptation of L.M. Montgomery's Victorian era novel about a spirited red-headed orphan and her adventures on Prince Edward Island. In this first installment of three, Anne Shirley arrives in Avonlea and soon finds a home with an elderly brother and sister, Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert. Before long, she discovers a bosom friend in Diana Barry and a rival in Gilbert Blythe. This is the definitive version of the beloved children's book, with flawless performances by Megan Follows, Colleen Dewhurst, Richard Farnsworth and Jonathan Crombie; a heart-stirring soundtrack; and an engaging plot that will delight children and adults alike! The perfect family-friendly movie for all generations. Anne of Green Gables: Anne of Avonlea Released in 1987, Kevin Sullivan's \"Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel\" (also known as \"Anne of Avonlea\") is a worthy adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's novel, Anne of Avonlea, continuing where the first installment, \"Anne of Green Gables\" ends. In this sequel, Anne Shirley leaves Avonlea to become a schoolteacher at a ladies college, after Diana Barry's marriage and Gilbert Blythe's departure for medical school. While at the school, Anne faces a number of challenges from a weathy family of Pringles, a stern principal determined to sour Anne's cheerful outlook on life, as well as a proposal from a dashing Morgan Harris! This is a rare sequel that rivals the humor, emotion, and elegance of its predecessor. Megan Follows returns to her memorable role as Anne, while Colleen Dewhurst (Marilla Cuthbert), Jonathan Crombie (Gilbert Blythe) and Schuyler Grant (Diana Barry) reprise their familiar characters. Oscar-winning actress Dame Wendy Hiller appears as the prickly Mrs. Harris, matriarch of the Pringle clan. Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story Sullivan Entertainment's final installment of the \"Anne of Green Gables\" trilogy is loosely based on the characters and setting from L.M. Montgomery's novels. In the concluding installment, Megan Follows returns in her memorable role of Anne Shirley. Now grown up, Anne and her fiance, Gilbert Blythe (Jonathan Crombie), return to Avonlea for the first time since Marilla Cuthbert's death. After visiting Diana Barry (Schuyler Grant) and a host of familiar characters from the first two miniseries, Gilbert persuades Anne to join him in New York City, where he will begin his medical tenure. Hoping to become a published writer, Anne joins a publishing firm and there meets a dashing yet arrogant novelist, Jack Garrison. After Gilbert and Anne face the disillusioning realities of their professions, they decide to return to Avonlea and finally get married. Their happiness is short-lived, however, when Gilbert enlists to serve in the first World War in Europe. After a series of harrowing events, including a chance encounter with Jack, Anne embarks on a journey that takes her through the horrors of war to find her true love, Gilbert.

DVD IS BRAND NEW, IN STOCK AND READY TO SHIP: Jan. 10th. The Release Date is: Jan 15th. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. The Complete 1st Season. ***THIS IS IT! FINALLY, THE NORTH AMERICAN RELEASE!!!! Edition Details: _ Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only) _ Color, Dolby, Box set _ Commentary by Joss Whedon on episodes 1 and 2 _ Theatrical trailer(s) _ 12 Episodes on 3 discs _ Interview with Joss Whedon and David Boreanaz _ Original pilot episode script _ Photo gallery _ Full-screen format _ Number of discs: 3 Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) looks like your typical perky high-schooler, and like most, she has her secret fears and anxieties. However, while most teens are worrying about their next date, their next zit, or their next term paper, Buffy's angsting over the next vampire she has to slay. See, Buffy, a young woman with superhuman strength, is the \"chosen one,\" and she must help rid the world of evil, namely by staking demons. The exceptional first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer introduces us to the treacherous world of Sunnydale High School (where Buffy moved after torching her previous high school's gym). The characters there include \"watcher\" Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) and the original \"Scooby Gang\" members--friendly geek Xander (Nicholas Brendon), computer whiz Willow (Alyson Hannigan), and snobbish popular girl Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter)--who aid Buffy in her quest. Those used to the darker tone that Buffy took in its later seasons will be surprised by the lighter feeling these first 12 episodes have--it's kind of like Buffy 90210 as the cast grapples with regular teen problems in addition to saving the world from demonic darkness. Fans of the show will enjoy the crisp writing, the phenomenal chemistry of the cast (already well-established within the first few episodes), and the introduction to characters that would stay for many seasons, including moody vampire Angel (David Boreanaz). Through it all, Gellar carries the series with amazing confidence, whether conveying the despair of high school or dispatching various demons--she's one of TV's most distinctive and strongest heroines.

Decades later, He returns home to recall the past - and the person who made it special (Jody Foster). Harmon and Foster star in Stealing Home , a bittersweet story \"beautifully written a la Moonstruck \" in which \"you'll spend a couple of hours lost in a wonderful world.\" As a burnout seeking redemption, Chicago Hope's Harmon hits the mark as the older Billy, and the luminous Foster sparkles as Kate, the friend and mentor who vibrantly draws the loose end of Billy's past and present together. Buoyed by a marvelous golden-oldies soundtrack, Stealing Home is a warm, wistful memory-lane journey.

It's a \"totally tubular\" scene as a \"grody-to-the-max\" punk from the wrong side of the Hollywood Hills, Randy (Nicolas Cage), falls for Julie (Deborah Foreman), a mall dwelling Valley Girl, in this time capsule of 1980s teen vernacular. Julie and Randy become passionately involved; yet, despite her feelings for Randy, Julie succumbs to the peer pressure of her mall obsessed friends, and gets back together with her Valley dude boyfriend, Tommy (Michael Bowen), who whisks Julie off to the Senior prom. Randy doesn't give up so easily, however, and chases Julie to the prom, with the help of his faithful friend, Fred (Cameron Dye), in an attempt to wrest her back. The sound track features the music of Men at Work, The Clash, and Josie Cotton in this 1980s teen comedy--an era, and topic, that director Coolidge was fond of chronicling, like her contemporary, John Hughes. sHIPPIN $4.00 pRIORITY MAIL Click Here!

The writers combine pun-filled humor and action. They have fun with the culture shock experienced by the mummies-come-to-life (the TV is a \"spirit box,\" a car is a \"swift chariot\"), as well as the requisite centerpiece battle in each episode. Presley, his four preserved protectors (including girl warrior Nefer-Tina voiced by the ubiquitous Cree Summer), and a mummified cat share a pleasant camaraderie, while the villains are predictably depraved.

In an effort to raise money for their fallen Sisters--unfortunate victims of a convent cooking accident--Mother Superior (The Golden Girls' Rue McClanahan) and her order of eccentric and endearing nuns show the lighter side of being Catholic.

But of course, in the middle of their show, chaos erupts! First, the Franciscans come to claim Sister Mary Amnesia, winner of the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes, as one of their own. Then, the nuns learn there is a talent scout in the audience who wants to see them strut their stuff.

In Calle 54, Madrid-based filmmaker Fernando Trueba explores the wide and wonderful world of Latin jazz: a hybrid genre that fuses the clave, samba, flamenco, meringue, and other rhythms from Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Americas. The film's Spanish title takes its name from Sony Music Studios located on 54th Street in Manhattan, where a who's who of musicians were filmed and recorded. They range from Brazilian bombshell keyboardist Eliane Elias and enigmatic Argentine tenor saxophonist Gato Barbieri, to the fiery rumba group Puntilla y Nueva Generacion. The music and musicians of Cuba and Puerto Rico dominate this documentary, and the most touching scene is the emotional father-and-son reunion of Cuban pianists Bebo and Chucho Vald s, who were separated by Fidel Castro's revolution. Sadly, the film features the last onscreen appearances by the late composer-arranger Chico O'Farrill and the legendary timbales master Tito Puente. Simply put, Calle 54 is a documentary that dances.

We bought several of these down in Mexico a long time ago, before the 1983 earthquake. This video is one of the original ones purchased and its original quality is intact . The scans of this video (below) are being provided to show how great it really is! Xavier, Miguel, Johnny, Ricky and Charlie sing, dance, and are seen only in their BATHING SUITS several times ! The story is about the group who rode in a balloon in order to get to their next concert destination, but get trapped at a house where some girls fall in love with them. You will see them and the girls playing in and around the swimming pool and playing on the beach. Johnny falls in love with a blonde-haired girl named Clara. And after singing the great song \"Senora Mia\" to Clara's mean aunt, they are allowed to go sing at their concert. This is a Spanish language video from the early '80's and was bought in Mexico. It was made and sold in Latin America, not the U.S. It lasts about 85 minutes and the music is as wonderful as the movie; you will be wanting to buy the CD if you don't already own it! The video comes in a clear plastic protective storage case (that I bought it in) to protect it from dust and damage, so it will stay in top quality condition for years to come. The protective case replaces any cover box, so the scans below are only being provided to show you what the tape is about.

These guys are hardly what you would think of as buff, and few can even dance. They simply take these problems in stride, because these are men with a plan--displaced, unemployed, and feeling suffocated by the women in their lives, they just want to earn a little respect. The dialogue and interaction between these men will have you screeching with laughter, but of equal importance is their sense of camaraderie and caring. First-time director Peter Cattaneo is a name to watch for; he easily conveys the sheer humanity of these people in their small town with their sad stories and irresistible sense of optimism.

I have taken them from many different soap magazines including Soap Opera Digest, Update, Weekly, News, Soap World, TV Soap, Soaps in Depth and many many more.

Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly, who accidentally gets sent back in time from 1985 to 1955 in a time machine that also happens to be a DeLorean automobile. The problem is to get enough of an electrical charge to get back to 1985, while leaving 1955 as it was. In the process, Marty meets his parents, jeopardizes their relationship, and risks his own existance. Marty McFly is the part Fox was born to play, but there are other great performances here, as well. Christopher Lloyd is excellent as \"Doc\" Brown, and Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas Wilson also help to make this a very entertaining movie. There is an extra attraction here for those of us who can remember the 1950's, and some of the gags based on Fox's out-of-time character are classic. Check out Marty playing \"Johnnie B. Goode\" as a bandmember holds up the phone so his \"cousin\", Chuck Berry, can listen and learn. This is not the cleverest or most sophisticated comedy around, but it is definitely great fun. I've watched it many times and expect to watch it many more. If you haven't got a copy, try to pick one up. You won't be sorry. II Like most of us I viewed Part 1, Part ll, and Part lll, each several months apart. Each movie was good in its own right. It wasn't until I sat down with all three films and watched them together, in order, that the true genius of the writing presented itself with about twenty five million jigawatts of fun and excitement. Of all three installments, Part ll is the most entertaining and spellbinding. For a fantasy this is about the best I've seen since the creation of Superman. It is not one single element of the film or the trilogy that make Back To The Future, a new twist on H.G. Wells The Time Machine. The surround sound is certainly out of this world. The special effects are second to none. Some may think this is a science fiction movie, and it is, but more then science fiction, Back To The Future is a love story about Marty McFly and his girlfriend, Jennifer, make no mistake about it. When you add the element of love to the comedic mix, special effects, and wonderful video production techniques, you have a spellbinding combination. The technique of going thirty years into the past and thirty years into the future allows the writer to capture sixty years of events in a format where the viewer is forced to examine how events in 1955 shape and change events in 1985 as well as 2015. In 1985 it was the Lybian terrorists, in 2001 it is Osama bin Laben and the Al-Queda terrorists. Sixteen years in the future and audiances can easily relate to the storyline. I urge those with a flair and yearning for a romantic comedy which is never going to be dated, to buy their own copy of Back To The Future, Part ll, as well as the two other movies in the trilogy. View them in order and you too will be saying, \"Doc, we don't have enough road to get up to 88!\" To which Doc Brown replies, \"Roads, where we're going, we don't need roads.\" Music up as the DeLorean zooms accross the screen in route, Back To The Future. See you in the future, I mean, the past, I mean, I concure with the words of Doc Brown, \"The future is not yet written, so make it a good one!\" But that line is from Part lll. III If there's any movie series I really love, it's the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy. In the original film, Marty McFly travels thirty years into the past (1955) where he tries to warn Doc of being murdered in the future, but his teenage mother-to-be falls in love with him instead of his father. In the first sequel, Marty and Doc went into Marty's future. And in the final episode, Marty travels back to the Wild West to prevent western cowboy Biff from murdering Doc. The series takes on a new charm with the romance between Doc and a schoolteacher he saves the life of, played by Mary Steenburgen. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd star.

This auction is for two brand new factory sealed The Beverly Hillbillies dvd. This would make a fantastic Christmas present for any classic tv show fan!

This is a list of the four titles: Jethros First Love The Great Feud The Clampetts Meet the Dodgers The Great Feud These dvds also contain Beverly Hillbillies Trivia, Hillbilly Lingo, Grannys Favorite Vittles, Direct Scene Access and Jeds Bio. About The Beverly Hillbillies One of CBS' longest - running situation comedies, this was the slapstick treatment of the Clampetts, an Ozark hillbilly family who struck it rich (an oil well sprouted in their front yard) and moved to a Beverly Hills mansion. They deposited the $25 million given to them by John Brewster, of the OK Oil Company, for drilling rights to their land, in Milburn Drysdale's Commerce Banks. As Drysdale's biggest depositors, they received special treatment. The banker, concerned about their naivete and ignorance of \"big city ways,\" moved them into the mansion next door to his own home, in hopes of keeping an eye on them and helping them become more civilized.

BILLPOINT OR PAYPAL PERFERRED WILL SHIP WITHIN 24 HRS. IF YOU USE THIS OPTION. Director Ron Howard casts comedian Jim Carrey in the title role in this live-action adaptation of the famous Christmas tale by Dr. Seuss, giving this rendition of HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS a delightfully manic spin. Carrey is virtually unrecognizable in his elaborate green makeup, but his anarchic comic touch is unmistakable. He manages to fully embody the grumpy title character, while still supplying his own comedic touches, and it is his performance that makes the film a treat for adults and children alike. The candy-colored set design for the town of Whoville and the jubilant score contribute to the overall feeling of innocuous fantasy that the Grinch disrupts with his dastardly deeds. The familiar story of the Grinch stealing every present in town on Christmas Eve has been expanded to incorporate flashbacks to the Grinch's childhood, which serve to explain his hostility toward the Whos. As Cindy Lou-Who, a little girl so sweet she sees goodness even in the Grinch, young Taylor Momsen strikes just the right note of adorable ingenuousness. Howard gets the performance the film needs from her, as her character makes the Grinch's eventual change of heart both believable and touching.
