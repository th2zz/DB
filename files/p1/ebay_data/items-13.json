During his career, Eddie Murphy has seen both great heights and remarkable lows. He is a true Hollywood celebrity who offers both great performances and laughably bad ones with a healthy dose of scandal thrown into the mix. Eddie was always too smart and too vocal for his own good. Growing up in the Bushwick projects in Brooklyn, New York, he used to stage big contests with his friends in which they would try and outdo each other with elaborate insults. He developed a knack for doing different voices from television at an early age and was the family entertainer. Being such a prominent celebrity took its toll- not only was his fast lane life scrutinized in the press, but many prominent black leaders also criticized him for doing little to help blacks break into Hollywood. He attempted to make up for things with 1991`s Harlem Nights, which boasted a large ensemble of black talent, but the film was a dud and audiences stayed away. Eddie has returned to box office success in more recent years with hits like Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor.

With his last breath, the guy tells Alvin something that makes no sense to the US Treasury agent, Clenteen, who soon interrogates Alvin. Eighteen months later, Clenteen wants to find the robbery's mastermind, an elusive computer genius named Bristol, so he lets Alvin loose, as bait. As Alvin tries to find a job, make peace with his girlfriend, and take on fatherhood to a baby born while he was in jail, he's an unwitting pawn caught between the murderous Bristol and the uptight, hard-nosed Clenteen.

Thers' nothing this motley collection of students won't do to get the best of Dean Wormer who secretly conspires to revoke Delta's charter. In addition to Belushi as the guitar bashing, beer can smashing, garbage eating Bluto Blutarsky, the outstanding cast includes head skirt-chaser Tim Matheson, innocent freshman Tom Hulce and Stephen \"Flounder\" Furst, along with Otis Day and the Knights with their showstopping performance of \"Shout\".

This is a MINT Souvenir Programme from Broadway's Virginia Theatre's 1988 Friedrich Kurtz/Royal Shakespeare Company's musical production of CARRIE, based on the novel by Stephen King.

The Power of One is an intriguing story of a young English boy named P.K. and his passion for changing the world. Growing up he suffered as the only English boy in an Afrikaans school. Soon orphaned, he was placed in the care of a German national named Professor von Vollensteen (a.k.a. \"Doc\"), a friend of his grandfather. Doc develops P.K.'s piano talent and P.K. becomes \"assistant gardener\" in Doc's cactus garden. It is not long after WWII begins that Doc is placed in prison for failure to register with the English government as a foreigner. P.K. makes frequent visits and meets Geel Piet, an inmate, who teaches him to box. Geel Piet spreads the myth of the Rainmaker, the one who brings peace to all of the tribes. P.K. is cast in the light of this myth. After the war P.K. attends an English private school where he continues to box. He meets a young girl, Maria, with whom he falls in love. Her father, Professor Daniel Marais, is a leader of the Nationalist Party of South Africa. The two fight to teach the natives English as P.K.'s popularity grows via the myth. Maria is killed. P.K. looses focus until he sees the success of his language school among the tribes. He and Guideon Duma continue the work in hopes of building a better future for Africa.

Joanna and Walter are the two newest residents in Stepford. Joanna, although a \"housewife\" is intelligent and creative - taking an interest in photography: she wants to be \"remembered\". Like many of the men in Stepford, Walter is an obviously inadequate husband. Conflict occurs when Joanna complains that Walter is making all of the decisions for them. Walter joins the mysterious Stepford \"Men's Club\", which takes place in an old manor house, which is heavily guarded. Joanna is disturbed that many of the Stepford wives spend their lives in domestic servitude, are unintelligent and wear flowery print dresses. Her friend Bobbie thinks that it might be due to something in the water. At a consciousness-raising group that Joanna starts, the wives begin discussing spray starch and cleaning products. The awful truth is that the men of Stepford are replacing their wives with compliant domestic sex robots. Gradually, Joanna begins to realise that all of her friends have been replaced, and that she is in great danger. Her psychiatrist advices that she takes the kids and gets \"the hell out of Stepford\", but the men are hiding Joanna's children. Can she find them, or will she be murdered and replaced by RoboJoanna? General Info: I DO NOT USE CHECKOUT! I haven't even bothered to look at it yet.

It is not a reprint or computer printed photo. Serious collectors know that original movie stills have the greatest collectible value.The quality of an original promotional still is outstanding--even the fine print is crystal clear. Get the real thing --not a reprint. You can own a piece of film history featuring one of your favorite films or film artists by adding an original still to your collection. As with many collectibles, you may find that you can have the pleasure of owning the photo and find that it will go up in value in time.

The scan is at a much lower resolution than the actual photo, which is crisp and clear.

Original promo stills are like limited edition prints in that only a small number are issued to the media by a film studio publicity department for newspaper, magazine and television promotion and go out of print soon thereafter. It is not a reprint or computer printed photo. Serious collectors know that original movie stills have the greatest collectible value.The quality of an original promotional still is outstanding--even the fine print is crystal clear. Get the real thing --not a reprint. You can own a piece of film history featuring one of your favorite films or film artists by adding an original still to your collection. As with many collectibles, you may find that you can have the pleasure of owning the photo and find that it will go up in value in time.

The scan is at a much lower resolution than the actual photo, which is crisp and clear. If the photo appears to have any flaws, such as blurring, discoloring or uneven borders--and they are not noted in the \"Condition\" box above--they are merely scanner distortions. Servers will often make photos appear lighter or darker--all of our original promo photos are perfectly exposed. The item may be set against a black background to improve the quality of the scan, but the item is in no way attached to the background..

Will his successor suffer the same fate? Was Bruce's power hereditary? He was born under the same sign and on the same day as his great-grandfather, a Samurai-master swordsman of the 19th century.

Click picture to enlarge Click picture to enlarge Click picture to enlarge Description THE BIG LEBOWSKI THE AWESOME US REGULAR ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER YOU ARE BIDDING ON THIS AWESOME MOVIE POSTER WHICH IS THE US REGULAR ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER AND IS IN MINT CONDITION, NEVER USED WITH SHARP EDGES AND CORNERS AND COMES ROLLED AND SHIPPED IN A PROTECTIVE TUBE (WE HAVE OVER 10 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE MAIL-ORDER BUSINESS SO BID WITH CONFIDENCE!!!). POSTER INFORMATION: THIS IS THE US ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER. IT MEASURES 27x40 (APPROX) AND IS AN ORIGINAL STUDIO RE-ISSUED MOVIE POSTER (NOT A POSTER-HOUSE REPRINT!!!). When the studios started to realize there was a mass market for their movie posters, they have gone back and re-issued several of them. This poster is one of them. It is identical to the first printing done by the studio. Only an appraiser could probably tell the difference. Now, as far as collectability goes, to give you an example - First printings for BIG LEBOWSKI posters sell for about $100 each (if you can even find one). The studio realized that this was not appropriate for the average person who wanted the poster for their wall and so they went back and re-issued the poster in mass quantity and so the value of the re-issues is not like the first printings, yet you get basically the same quality. This provides an affordable alternative for someone to obtain a poster for a movie like THE BIG LEBOWSKI. Again, this is NOT a poster-house reprint. Those are photocopies of the originals and the quality is not nearly as good. I offer a complete satisfaction guarantee on all my products!!!

Jr. From story: Who Goes There? Set In: Arctic Color type: Technicolor Cinematic Process: Panavision Produced by: Universal Description: John Carpenter's The Thing is both a remake of Howard Hawks' 1951 film of the same name and a re-adaptation of the John W. Campbell Jr. story \"Who Goes There?\" on which it was based. Carpenter's film is more faithful to Campbell's story than Hawks' version and also substantially more reliant on special effects, provided in abundance by a team of over 40 technicians, including veteran creature-effects artists Rob Bottin and Stan Winston. The film opens enigmatically with a Siberian Husky running through the Antarctic tundra, chased by two men in a helicopter firing at it from above. Even after the dog finds shelter at an American research outpost, the men in the helicopter (Norwegians from an outpost nearby) land and keep shooting. One of the Norwegians drops a grenade and blows himself and the helicopter to pieces; the other is shot dead in the snow by Garry (Donald Moffat) the American outpost captain. American helicopter pilot MacReady (Kurt Russell, fresh from Carpenter's Escape From New York) and camp doctor Copper (Richard Dysart) fly off to find the Norwegian base and discover some pretty strange goings-on. The base is in ruins, and the only occupants are a man frozen to a chair (having cut his own throat) and the burned remains of what could be one man or several men. In a side room, Copper and MacReady find a coffin-like block of ice from which something has been recently cut.... That night at the American base, the Husky changes into the Thing, and the Americans learn first-hand that the creature has the ability to mutate into anything it kills. For the rest of the film the men fight a losing (and very gory) battle against it, never knowing if one of their own dwindling number is the Thing in disguise. Though resurrected as a cult favorite, The Thing failed at the box office during its initial run, possibly because of its release just two weeks after Steven Spielberg's warmly received E.T.: The Extraterrestrial. Along with Ridley Scott's futuristic Alien, The Thing helped stimulate a new wave of sci/fi horror films in which action and special effects wizardry were often seen as ends in themselves. ? Anthony Reed This remake of the 1950s classic is primarily a showcase for the gory special effects of Rob Bottin. Dogs are ripped open by tentacled beasts, people's faces stretch to inhuman dimensions, and all sorts of bloody mayhem ensues, while the cast stands around covered with ice crystals and sniping at each other. There are a few creepy moments, but most of them result in another of Bottin's admittedly amazing creations. If you like gore and can often be seen reading Fangoria magazine, this is a must-see. If, on the other hand, your preference is for more subtle horror (or even character development), you may want to look elsewhere. ?

This extremely rare life mask shows a much younger Alfred Hitchcock, with his eyes sculpted open by the Universal Studios make up department.

That original mask hung on the wall of a studio office for many years, but 'retired' when our source did! I don't know exactly when or why the original mask was taken, but comparing it with our 'older' Hitchcock life mask you can see that here his face is much more youthful, not suffering the effects of gravity nearly as much. His lip line is also much stronger in this mask, showing the trade mark pouting lower lip. This numbered and limited edition cast is an exact image of the youthful face of one of the cinema's greatest directors. This is Mr. Hitchcock's face as it looked early in his career.

I have seen other videos exactly like this one, without the signature, I have few other copies like this one, with the signature, none of the signatures are exactly alike. What I am saying, is, you can tell the signatures belong to Bobby Allison, but they certainly do not look like they were factory stamped identically, each one perfect like the other signatures. In other works, it looks like he signed each video jacket! I am not saying he did. I have no verification to back that fact up. As I said before, no two signatures look as though they ere perfectly stamped from a factory stamp. The jacket cover was created by artist, Tony Comtec. The use of red, white, and blue were the primary colors of choice for the jacket cover, on back of cover is full length picture of his pride and joy Number 12 Buick race car, with Miller High Life endorsements, painted gold. Bobby Allison named this film, High Banks and Fast Turns. On front of video jacket is drawing of Bobby holding one of his all time famous trophies and cheering on the races. This is by all means a collector's choice video of the late great race car driver, Bobby Allison.

Love sex and intelligence The trio which comprised Sublime vocalist/guitarist Nowell, bassist Eric Wilson and drummer Bud Gaugh played their first gig on the 4th of July 1988 at a small Long Beach club (a show which sparked the infamous Peninsula Riot). The group began aggressively touring around the area with an increasingly substantial following, especially among the surf/skate beach crowd. After four years of concentrating strictly on live shows, Sublime's first album (40 Oz. to Freedom) was recorded in 1992. The LP was released on Skunk Records the label formed by Nowell with Sublime manager Miguel and sold at shows, but really started to break when KROQ began playing the single \"Date Rape\" two years after its initial release.

Many of these ads were painted, drawn, or photographed by the best illustrators or photographers of their day, making them extremely valuable today. Unfortunately a large number of the ads were destroyed each week when new issues of the magazine came out making them EXTREMELY COLLECTIBLE. Wrinkles or different shades of colors are defects of the scanner and not the advertisement. Some ads consist of both pages untrimmed, and others have been carefully trimmed down the crease to insure you receive the complete ad. Some ads have staple holes or a rough edge on one side but this can be covered by matting and framing. CHECK OUT MY OTHER AUCTIONS OF ADS, MAGAZINES, BOOKS, SHEET MUSIC AND STUFF!!!!

GUARANTEED AUTHENTIC Lee Marvin Date of birth 19 February 1924, New York, New York, USA Date of death 29 August 1987, Tucson, Arizona, USA. (heart attack) Biography for Lee Marvin[? Height 6' 3\" Mini biography Prematurely white-haired character star who began as a supporting player of generally vicious demeanor, then metamorphosed into a star of both action and drama projects. Born in New York City to Lamont Marvin, an advertising executive, and his wife Courtenay, a fashion writer, the young Marvin was thrown out of dozens of schools for incorrigibility. His parents took him to Florida, where he attended St. Leo's Preparatory School near Dade City. Dismissed there as well, he enlisted in the U.S. Marines at the beginning of World War II. In the battle of Saipan in June 1944, he was wounded in the buttocks by Japanese fire which severed his sciatic nerve. He was invalided home and got menial work as a plumber's apprentice in Woodstock, New York. While repairing a toilet at the local community theatre, he was asked to replace an ailing actor in a rehearsal. He was immediately stricken with a love for the theatre and went to New York City, where he studied and played small roles in stock and Off-Broadway. He landed an extra role in Henry Hathaway's U.S.S. Teakettle, and found his role expanded when Hathaway took a liking to him. Returning to the stage, he made his Broadway debut in Billy Budd, and after a long succession of small TV roles, moved to Hollywood, where he began playing heavies and cops in roles of increasing size and frequency. Given a leading role in Eight Iron Men, he followed it with enormously memorable heavies in The Big Heat and The Wild One. Now established as a major screen villain, Marvin began shifting toward leading roles with a successful run as a police detective in the TV series 'M Squad'. A surprise Oscar for his dual role as a drunken gunfighter and his evil, noseless brother in the Western comedy Cat Ballou placed him in the upper tiers of Hollywood leading men, and he filled out his career with predominantly action-oriented films. A long-term romantic relationship with Michelle Triola led, after their breakup, to a highly publicized lawsuit in which Triola asked for a substantial portion of Marvin's assets. Her case failed in its main pursuit, but did establish a legal precedent for the rights of unmarried cohabitors, the so-called \"palimony\" law. Marvin continued making films of varying quality, always as a star, until his sudden death from a heart attack in 1987. Spouse 'Pamela Feeley' (18 October 1970 - 29 August 1987) (his death) 'Betty Ebeling' (February 1951 - 5 January 1967) (divorced) Trivia Says he learned to \"act\" in the Marines, trying to act unafraid during ferocious combat, which brought him a Purple Heart during invasion of Saipan. The body of Lee Marvin was interred next to that of Joe Louis in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Va. USA. Son Christopher born 1952. Daughter Courtenay born 1954. Daughter Cynthia born 1956. Daughter Claudia born 1958. Was a direct descendant of both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Was Spielberg's first choice for the role of Quint in Jaws (1975). Personal quotes \"Tequila. Straight. There's a real polite drink. You keep drinking until you finally take one more and it just won't go down. Then you know you've reached your limit.\" Upon accepting his Best Actor Academy Award for \"Cat Ballou,\" 1966: \"I think half of this belongs to a horse somewhere out in the valley.\" Biography from Leonard Maltin's Movie Encyclopedia: Rugged actor who, like many tough-looking leading men, started his movie career as a heavy, then graduated to heroic roles when he became a star. Marvin, a WW2 veteran, took up acting in the late 1940s following an unfulfilling stint as a plumber. Initially appearing in summer stock and off-Broadway productions, he graduated to the Great White Way in 1951. That same year, he broke into movies with a bit part in You're in the Navy Now and two years later achieved recognition as the psychopathic gang leader who hurled scalding coffee in his girlfriend's face in The Big Heat (1953). Marvin also played a rival gangleader in The Wild One (1954), a nasty townsman in Bad Day at Black Rock a burned-out jazzman in Pete Kelly's Blues (both 1955), and Western baddies in Gun Fury, The Stranger Wore a Gun (both in 1953), Seven Men From Now (1956), and The Comancheros (1961). After starring for three seasons on the TV cop show \"M Squad\" (1957-60), he reached his apex as a big-screen bad guy playing the whipcracking terror of John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962), which starred John Wayne and James Stewart. Following the lighthearted Donovan's Reef (1963, again for Ford), Marvin returned to form as the contract killer who guns down crime boss Ronald Reagan (in his last film) in The Killers (1964). He followed that with a memorable turn as a washed-up ball player in Ship of Fools (1965). Next came the Western spoof Cat Ballou (also 1965); Marvin's dual role as a drunken gunslinger and a tin-nosed desperado won him an Oscar and elevated him to leading-man status. He maintained it by heading up two all-star action blockbusters, The Professionals (1966) and The Dirty Dozen (1967), and for the next 20 years gave solid performances in such varied films as the quirky thriller Point Blank (1967), the two-man war movie Hell in the Pacific (1968), the big-budget musical Paint Your Wagon (1969), the elegiac Western Monte Walsh (1970), the satiric gangster opus Prime Cut (1972), the allegorical train adventure Emperor of The North (1973), the comic Western Great Scout and Cathouse Thursday (1976), and Sam Fuller's autobiographical war film, The Big Red One (1980), which gave him one of his all-time best parts as an indomitable sergeant in the infantry. Later films include Death Hunt (1980), Gorky Park (1983), The Delta Force (1986), and a TV movie sequel The Dirty Dozen: The Next Mission (1985). Perhaps his most underrated work was his performance as Hickey in the 1973 film adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh Marvin also left a legacy of quite a different sort: his longtime companion, Michelle Triola, successfully sued him for support after their breakup, bringing the word \"palimony\" into the American lexicon.

Thanks and good luck! The Godfather II 5 stars!--Both sequel and prequel to The Godfather (1972), Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, Part II (1974) delves further into the dark side of the capitalist American Dream by paralleling the young Vito Corleone's 1910s rise with his son Michael's 1950s spiritual fall. To create a more contemplative view of the Corleones' American success story, Coppola cross-cut between Vito's story (in subtitled Italian) and Michael's, revealing how the honorable aim of protecting the family degenerates into an excuse for wielding lethal power, for the sake only of business. Images of Vito's parental concern and immigrant neighborhood dealings dissolve to Michael's familial disintegration and U.S. Senate subterfuge. Cinematographer Gordon Willis's warm sepia tones for the Vito sequences recall period photographs, contrasting sharply with the crass brightness and cold shadows of 1950s Lake Tahoe and Havana. With the memory of The Godfather present in Robert De Niro's uncanny evocation of Marlon Brando and in flashbacks to 1942, Coppola underlines how much The Godfather's potentially alluring myth of family unity begat horrific violence; the film becomes both a critique of responses to the first film that may have glorified its family-oriented violence and a more explicit and mournful allegory of American corporate violence and corruption across the 20th century. These aspects, together with the unique cross-cut narrative, give the movie a richer dimension and a wider scope than the first one's family drama, and it was hailed by most observers as the rare sequel that equaled, or even surpassed, the original. A box office hit, it was nominated for 10 Oscars and won 6, including Best Picture, the Director prize denied Coppola in 1972, Supporting Actor for De Niro, Art Direction, and Score. Years of sequel plans finally produced The Godfather Part III in 1990; and parts I and II were later cut together in chronological order for TV as The Godfather Saga, eliminating this film's cross-cut structure. Often equated with Citizen Kane (1941), The Godfather Part II remains one of the most artistically challenging popular films ever made. _ Lucia Bozzola Go to Allmovie.com for all your movie needs!

You will receive your items quicker by allowing me to split the work of processing orders among my partners. Theses preprints are among the best quality I have ever seen and are exact replicas of the original Hand Signed Versions that I have in my display cases covering the walls of my home and office space. Many of these original photos are worth over $100.00 and here you can have an exact replica for a fraction of the cost. I promise 99.9% of the people who receive these photos have a very very very hard time telling the difference from the original hand signed one. These things are so damn good that even I can barely tell the difference from the originals when they are both in my hand, and when they are hanging onm the wall in a picture frame it is virtually impossible. These replicas are wonderful for bars, restaurants, club houses, ect where theft is a possibility. Customers will think they are real and it one gets stolen or damaged it not like your out hundreds of dollars. Shipping is $2.00 no matter how many you buy!!! $5.00 outside USA.

William O'Connell, Ben Baker, Alan Baxter, Paula Trueman, Robert Easton And Directed By: Joshua Logan. This blockbuster musical is set in No Name City, California during the gold rush, this musical comedy concerns prospectors Ben and Pardner and their unusual nuclear family. The business partners strike a deal to share Ben's wife Elizabeth, whom Ben purchased from a Mormon. But the free-thinking Ben is worried about rivalry over Elizabeth from the town's all-male population, hungry for female company. So he arranges to kidnap a stagecoach full of working girls on their way to a nearby city, and sets up a brothel in No Name. That puts the place on the map and business booms, but competition for gold also grows. Later, needing cash to survive the winter, Ben and an accomplice, Mad Jack Duncan, tunnel under the town's buildings to catch loose golddust falling from the floorboards. But No Name collapses under the strain, and everyone moves on, except for Pardner and Elizabeth. Adapted from the hit Broadway play.
