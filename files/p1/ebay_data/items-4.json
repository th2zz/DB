Both plates are in mint condition with the exception of very small chips in the center rim of the back which are hard to see, and do not affect the front of the plate at all.

The designs of this region are varied and are not used as a guide to the origin of the rug. Distinctive designs are associated with particular towns and villages such as Bibikabad, Ingelas, Dergezin, and Husianabad, all are generally referred to as Hamadans. Key characteristics are similarities in weave and colors. Almost all Hamadans are single wefted, a row of weft runs between each row of knots, using the Turkish/Symmetrical knot, with 40-100 knots per square inch. Most of the rugs of this region use similar strong, dark colors, including reds, blues, ivory and brown. Often they are woven mixing goat or camel hair mixed with wool or cotton. Designs are bold and geometric, incorporating many hexagonal and diamond-shaped designs including sharply angled medallions and zigzag patterns, which represent lightening. Stylized florals and utilization of the herati pattern are also quite common. Many older pieces, mostly runners, were woven on wool foundations with undyed camel hair and are therefore camel colored. Modern rugs have cotton foundations with stronger, darker colors, often with bright accent colors. It is now very rare to find them in the classic camel color. Hamadans are considered some of the best values in Persian rugs. _ Click HERE for answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

Handling charges are to cover the cost for padded envelopes, pressure-sensitive tape, etc. I do my very best in packing all items to ensure they do not incur damage in transit.

SHIPPING SCHEDULE Most items are shipped by USPS Priority Mail. Some paper items (i.e. photos, magazines, etc.) will be shipped by First Class Mail. Items will be shipped ASAP after receipt of payment. Shipment of items paid for by personal check may be delayed for a period of from 7-10 working days, until it clears the bank. Because I cannot go to the bank every day, that is based on date of deposit, which is not always the date of receipt. Insofar as delivery is concerned, there have been sporadic delays in mail distribution, due to the anthrax threat. I have no control over this. If you are the successful bidder on more than one of my auctions, that close within a 3-day period, I will combine the shipping for you. I no longer send Shipping Notices. FEEDBACK I generally post feedback for buyers within 2-3 days after receipt of payment.

This is the periscopic sextant that was used by the USAF and CAF during the last 45 years. It was used on the B-47, B-52, C-54, C-97, C-118, C-119, C-121, C-124, KC-135, and other aircraft. It was used by the navigator or other crewmember to determine the altitude of a celestial body measured and recorded with reference to a bubble artificial horizon. A two power lens is incorporated into the periscope. Inertial and doppler navigation systems as well as GPS systems replaced the navigator and celestial navigation with this sextant. To illuminate the bubble and altitude counter a 28 volt D.C. aircraft supply was used. The sextant pictured below comes complete with a power connecting cable, spare light bulbs, and fiberglass storage case. It is in very good used condition, but sold as is. This is a fantastic gift for an aviation memorabilia collector, or former crew member on one of the above airplanes, so don't delay in your bidding.

In 1986, a groundbreaking miniseries took the industry by storm, revolutionizing forever the way people envisioned the comic-book medium. Now acclaimed writer/artist Frank Miller is set to do it again, with the most anticipated comics sequel of all time... THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN. It's been three years since the events of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, and everything is just fine. Perfect, in fact. At least on the surface. What the world at large doesn't know is that it's a total sham. A perfectly choreographed, pretty little world where everything that's ugly, or even potentially disturbing, is all nicely wrapped up with neat little ribbons and swept under the carpet. Only he knows better. He's watched it fester to near-breaking point, and it's time for the only free man left who can effect any real change to bring it all down around their ears, once and for all. It's not gonna be pretty. But at least it'll be honest. The Dark Knight returns once again -- trimmer, more streamlined, and with a vitality that hasn't been seen since the first years of his war on crime. Together with his army of Bat-soldiers, including Carrie Kelley -- formerly Robin, and now the new Catgirl -- the Dark Knight wages a new war on a diseased world that's become completely lost. But to fight this war successfully, he must first return to being the World's Greatest Detective and discover what has become of his former allies who were once the World's Greatest Heroes. THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN will be told in 3-parts -- each issue a whoppin' 80 pages in Prestige Format -- masterfully written and illustrated by Frank Miller and featuring the magnificent colors of Miller's collaborator, Lynn Varley. Published by DC Comics, 2002. Bagged & Boarded. We have over 25 years comic book experience and grade by Overstreet standards so bid with confidence. NOTE!!!

The pitcher is white and has gray trim around the rim and on the handle. The enamel is faded and dull and I believe the trim was probably black when it was new (probably many years ago). It appears to be very well made, but there is some rust primarily at the rim of the base, and the bottom - both inside and out.

The same year, Tenyo also released the Menta-Marvel effect. However, unlike a majority of the Tenyo effects from the early 90s that are still in good supply, Menta-Marvel has become very difficult to find. Another interesting aspect of the Menta-Marvel effect is that it retailed for a bit more than other Tenyo items of its time_I believe I paid around $25 or $30 for this. Menta-Marvel was created by Yutaka Sato and is now a discontinued Tenyo item. For those of you not familiar with the Menta-Marvel effect, the back side of the packaging is shown in the picture below and gives a description of the effect. Supplied with the prediction board is a carrying case, a chinese crayon (if necessary, this can be replaced with a similar chinese crayon available at any office supply store), and also a cleverly-constructed set of ESP cards. The packaging has a few creases, the plastic _bubble_ has a couple small cracks and some dirt marks, however the apparatus appears to be in excellent condition. Here_s a chance to pick up what is possibly one of the most difficult post-_T-150_ Tenyo effects to find. If you have any questions about this trick, or if you_re having trouble viewing the images, please feel free to contact me through eBay_s _Ask Seller A Question_ feature. I welcome any questions, but please try to ask questions early, as I may not be able to respond to questions submitted shortly before the auction ends.

Background is a soft shade of grey with a scenic garden design featuring green and grey leafed, as well as pink blossoming trees, garden statuary and columns. The colors feature several shades of grey, green, pink, with some white accenting. The design shown in the first picture is repeated randomly across the panels. Each panel of this pair measures 33\" across the top edge, 67\" across the bottom edge, and are 44\" in length with a generous 6\" hem. They are lined with an ivory fabric, which I believe is probably silk. They are a heavy weight, and are obviously quite well made. The lighting in the first picture shows them to be a bit darker than they actually are; the second photo shows more of the true coloring. Due to the width of the panels there is a lengthwise seam running down each panel. This pair of vintage barkcloth curtains is one of 2 pair of the same design and color that I am listing. U.S. Shipping Cost: $8.50 Please contact me for International Shipping Rates as they are slightly higher. Multiple purchases from my auctions can be combined to save on shipping costs. Condition: These drapes are in excellent condition. They have been well taken care of by the previous owners. There are no stains, holes, or worn spots that I can find. The colors are still bright. The ivory lining (which I believe is silk, but am not guaranteeing) has darked some from age, somewhat more noticeably so in the folds, but I see no evidence of water staining, etc. As with the barkcloth, the lining also does not have any noticeable holes or tears.

Email me any of your questions not specifically addressed in my description......reddog1988@aol.com I want my bidders/customers to know that you can purchase my items with the utmost confidence. I have been a Depression Glass and American Art Pottery collector for 25 years. You can be assured that the item that you are bidding on will be as I have described it. My honesty is impeccable, and my feedback speaks for itself. As a collector, who has made many purchases on eBay, I know the heartache of dealing with sellers that have no business selling glassware, china, and pottery. Their incompetence in describing and packaging their items can really become problematic for the serious collector trying to make a purchase for their collections. PLEASE be assured that your transaction with me will be a GREAT experience. I can accept money orders and checks as valid means of payment. The winning bidder should expect to pay $5 towards the cost of three day priority shipping. The cost of insurance will be determined after the auction's closing. Customers using the BUY IT NOW option will receive FREE insurance. Payment MUST be received within 10 days of being contacted by me. All of my items on eBay are 100% GUARANTEED to be as described. Due to family commitments, on occasion I may be called out of town for a few days. I_ll answer emails immediately upon my return, so please don_t panic if you don_t hear from me right away. Due to the increased instability of the eBay site, it may be a wise decision to bookmark this auction if you are interested in bidding upon it. Recently, the MY EBAY and SEARCH functions have not been working properly on eBay, and my customers have been unable to find previously viewed items. Paul's Sweet Cherry Brandy 5-21-88 to 8-26-00.

There were several drug companies in that part of town and visitors coming over the bridge from Oklahoma used to be greeted by a very large sign advertising laxatives...which made me wonder just what people thought of my hometown. Other than that I know nothing about this bottle. It is an unusual size I've been told, it is 2 and 7/16th inches wide by 7 and 1/4 inches tall. It has a measuring rule in the glass on either side, one is in CC's and the other I'm guessing is ounces and if I'm right this bottle held 8 ounces of something that I bet made you sleep real well at night......funny how the whiskey warehouses and the drug companies were side by side in old Fort Smith. The bottle is in good condition with a couple of little chips...the worst can be seen in the 3rd scan below. It comes with dirt and stains still inside from being buried for years. But the bottle would still hold 8 oz of Dr. Kick'em Up if you had a cork to keep the juice inside. The lettering is very sharp on this bottle and its a miracle it's still around.

Color front and back is outstanding...Front cover by Keith Pollard and Doug Herrings original version of Thor. Back cover Dave Cockrums original character model sheet of El Aguila. Comic is in Exc shape. No..binding dimples, binding corners are great..no paper loss.or bumping but just a pencil point size color loss on very tips. edges are sharp and clean . Opening corners ars Excellent. Front cover has a very light indentation from what looks to be where someone may have stacked another book on top of it in a of set direction. This is new and may flatten out with time..It is only on the cover page and does not go through. 62 pages long The pages in this are an off white..Now I think they may have been this color when printed..or close to a newspaper color..I say this becasue when you turn into the book there are some very white pages see the last 2 pics for the comparison...If they were all white to start with...They would all yellow at the same rate of time and be very close to the same color as each other..Its amazing that this held up as well as it did..Considering the fragile nature of the grade of paper used for the cover...It is not much above a newspaper stock..Not to mention how well the color held up. The art work front and back and the condition of it are amazing..I love the way it re-creates an old style look and feel. I do not think anyone will be dissapointed with this issue.
