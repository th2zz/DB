THIS BURMESE JADE BANGLE SHOULD RETAIL FOR ABOUT $450.00 OR MORE IN ANY GOOD JEWELRY STORE THAT SELLS FINE JADE. I HAVE ABOUT 15 OF THESE BANGLES ALL CUT FROM THE SAME STONE AND WILL BE USING THIS PICTURE FOR ALL SINCE THEY ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE, MOST WILL HAVE THREE GREEN SPOTS LIKE THE PICTURE AND JUST A FEW HAVE ONLY TWO GREEN SPOTS.

It is also worth bearing in mind when buying Jade that somewhere in the region of 85% of the Jade sold in the retail jewelry stores are treated in some way whether they tell you or NOT, indeed even if they know it themselfs !! It has been my personal experience that most jeweler's have very little or no knowledge at all about Jade, even though they say they do. I have been a direct importer of fine Jade jewelry for over ten years now, I personally travel to Burma, Thailand, & China to hand pick all my Jade items for sale. It has taken me years to know the grades and differant qualities of Jade, and I have learned from the old masters in the orient, not in some classroom. Thanks for your time and I hope I can be of some help to any of my customer's. I NOW ACCEPT VISA AND MASTERCARD PAYMENT THROUGH PAYPAL.COM. IT IS FREE, FAST, EASY AND VERY SECURE.

(Car Coat length). It is made of a heavy wool. It is a beautiful fall/winter color and just a true classic. Note that it has four patch pockets in the front with snap closures, and there is a small midline vent in the back. Made of the typical urban materials signature of Armani Exchange. The jacket is fully lined and there is padding also. Beautiful winter/fall/early spring coat which you can wear with literally ANYTHING! The lining of the jacket is 54% acetate/46% nylon, and the padding (filling of the jacket) is 100% polyester. The shell of the jacket (the part which is on the outside is 80%wool/20% nylon. The added nylon to the shell is VERY helpful because it prevents the wool from pilling into furballs. Any flaws seen in the photos are due solely to the resolution of the digital camera. All buttons are intact!. I purchased this jacket from A/X for about $200. The measurements of the jacket: Armpit to armpit across the chest = 24.5inches; bottom of the collar to end of the jacket = 35 inches in length. Great bargain! Goes nicely with black or grey or even khakis. I accept money order or Paypal only. Please email seller with any additional questions.

If the shipping charge stated is less than $3.50, the item is shipped via first class mail which is normally 2 to 4 days to anywhere in the USA. There is no delivery confirmation available on this and packages in rare instances have taken up to two weeks to arrive (way less than 1% of the time). Past history in shipping tells us that the Post Office actually does a very good job in December, yet with the volume of mail they process, packages do sometimes get misrouted. All items with a stated shipping charge of $3.50 or more are already shipped via priority mail, most with a delivery confirmation. Priority mail shipping with a delivery confirmation number sent to you is available on any item we sell where the shipping charge is stated at under $3.50. The cost for this is $4 and applies to the ties and most of the small ornaments that we are selling. If you want this service just submit $4 in place of any lower shipping amount stated and we will ship priority mail. Express mail overnight shipping is also available at a cost of $13.00 up to 8 ounces (single ties), 8 ounces to 2 pounds at $17 (most plates) and 2 to 3 pounds, $20. This is guaranteed overnight to most of the USA but may take two days to more rural areas.

UNITED STATES BIDDERS ONLY PLEASE! *HOW DO YOU KNOW IF THIS WILL FIT YOU?* SEE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO MEASURE FOR FIT FOUND AT BOTTOM OF PAGE AS WELL AS MEASUREMENTS GIVEN BELOW! All bidders are asked to read the terms of service listed HERE . (Please click on \"HERE\" to read them) Bidding implies that you have read all the terms and agree to abide by them. Misunderstandings can often be prevented by taking this simple step prior to placing your bid for any auction item. Combined auction wins shipped together to save on postage costs will be done only for auctions ending THE SAME DAY. I go to the post office and ship out in bulk once weekly, often twice weekly depending on volume. Please do not ask for SPECIAL DELIVERY as I cannot do time-sensitive shipping. After you pay for an auction, it will generally be shipped on the following post office day I have planned. In most cases where the outfit is sized too large for my mannequin excess fabric has been cinched behind the mannequin's back to simulate the proper fit of the garment. DO NOT GO BY THE PICTURES when thinking about fit issues, REFER TO THE MEASUREMENTS ONLY! See instructions at the bottom of this page for HOW TO DETERMINE FIT. I Accept Credit Card/Check Card Payments For My Auctions at the Following: SIZE INFORMATION...The return policy here at RHIANNON'S TREASURES is that all sales are final unless the item has been misrepresented, I am selling merchandise at well below retail in most cases (and often times even lower than clearance) and as such cannot absorb the cost of returned merchandise like department stores and high priced boutiques can do, so please familarize yourself with the correct method to use when determining a proper fit. The measurements I give you are with the garment laid flat and measured side to side, then I double that number to attain the total available room in the garment. The best way to compare is to take a garment that has a similar cut and/or style that you know fits you well and take those measurements with the garment lying on a flat surface (just as I am doing) and double that. BE SURE TO MEASURE THE BUST WAIST AND HIP AT THEIR ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM. Keep in mind that you need to be at least TWO inches smaller than the measurements I am giving in order to have a proper fit. All brand names are the sole property of their owners as well as all service marks, copyrights, and logos pictured or mentioned in the description. Their inclusion here does not in any way imply endorsement of these brands by their respective owners and are listed here as a fully independent sale. ALL AUCTION ITEMS ARE CAREFULLY STORED ON HANGERS IN A TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED 100% SMOKE FREE ENVIRONMENT. Each and every item I ship to you has been treated with the utmost of TLC, just the way I treat my own personal clothing, and will arrive on your doorstep carefully folded and smelling fresh and clean. I think one of the most delightful things about buying new clothing is that wonderful one-of-a-kind fresh crisp feel and aroma they have, and I want you to enjoy this as well so rest assured that your clothing has been carefully stored and handled and will never have noxious odors clinging to them when they arrive at your home. There are no smokers anywhere even near our property, so you won't have any unpleasant olfactory \"surprises\" when you open your package from RHIANNON'S TREASURES. Florida residents please include 6% sales tax."}, {"ItemID": "1675358622", "Name": "DUCKHEAD hunter green polo s/s sz XL", "Category": ["Clothing & Accessories", "Men", "Clothing: Regular", "Shirts", "Casual", "Short Sleeve"], "Currently": "$3.00", "First_Bid": "$3.00", "Number_of_Bids": "0", "Bids": null, "Location": "Starkville, MS", "Country": "USA", "Started": "Dec-08-01 16:21:22", "Ends": "Dec-15-01 16:21:22", "Seller": {"UserID": "jnoe713", "Rating": "16"}, "Description": "Duckhead hunter green polo in great condition.

The sleeves are slightly cuffed and on the center neck area there is an embroidered red heart to match the jumper's buttons. The jumper is in an adoreable gingham check/houndstooth-like pattern, deep scoop neck A-line style, and buttons up the back. There is solid black piping trim all the way around the bottom and some for detailing on the front of the dress. This style allows for a nice generous fit for long wearability. There are also little red heart buttons applied to the chest and faux pockets on the front for a \"loving\" touch! Wouldn't this be especially cute for Valentines Day?! But wear it now too, don't just save it for February! Made of a great medium weight fabric perfect for fall/winter weather and looks great with lightweight or thick tights and black patent shoes. My girls liked short sleeve sweaters because they always got too warm in Sunday school class--this is the perfect style. Unfortunately we moved to Hawaii before they really got a chance to wear this dress, it was maybe worn 1-2 times total so is in excellent condition.

Classical elegance, this outfit can take you easily from meetings to dinner! The quality 100% Merino wool, fully lined pants are jet black, and appropriate for cold weather. They have an elegant cut, with 2 small (not exaggerated!) pleads on each side, straight cut leg (no cuff), front zipper closure, and diagonal pockets. The full lining is completely attached to the pants' hem (not just stitched here and there). In just-like-new condition, show no sign of wear, but just out of box so they might need a lint brush. Otherwise, perfect shape. They have a high end men's suit pants style cut. Very well made and elegant. The marked size is 12, but is a small 12 -- please check the measurements below: Waist: 28.5\"-29\" Length: 41\" total - 29\" inseam Leg width at bottom: 9.25\" The blouse/shirt I am including in this auction, I have (gently) worn but is in very good shape as you can see from the look of the label in the closeup picture. No spots, holes, or any damage that I can see or find. I usually choose dry cleaning even where machine wash is allowed, and ALWAYS with shirts! Hate to iron! The only thing I can think of, is the first knot that acts as a button has been let out a bit to accommodate my fuller pregnant-woman breasts (sigh... where are they now??? lol) It is a feminine and not boring white shirt as I hope the pictures could show (both the pants and the shirt/blouse are very difficult to photograph due to the colors). It does not have a size label, but please check the measurements below. Shoulder to shoulder: 17\" Bust: approx. 18.5\" across (37\" total) Sleeves: 21\" Length: 20\" I am throwing in the accessories shown in the pictures: a pair of black and white earrings and a faux pearl string but I usually wore with the blouse at the office. If you have any questions, I'll be glad and try to answer them. More boxes still to unpack here , more stuff still coming down from Manhattan!

I've used a very detailed,sterling, man in the moon face with a pave finish,(little rhinestones to make it sparkle!)with little Crystal dangles as the centerpiece. The necklace is all wireworked in sterling for durability ,using 3 sizes of the hottest new color of Swarovski Austrian crystal,Tanzanite, a rich periwinkle/violet. Please note the ends of my necklaces, I actually wirework the chain onto the closure, not just cut it and reclose it. Although that method saves time, it greatly compromises the strength of the necklace and I don't do it.The necklace can be worn up to 17 1/4inches or anywhere in between, simply by hooking up a link int he soldered chain.

It is a Lang sterling vermeil (gold over sterling) with tiny genuine stones. Unfortunately, I don't know what kind of stones. They are a black-green color. Necklace is approx. 17\" long and very dainty. This has never been worn - it was purchased from the inventory of a gift shop that went out of business in the late 80's. It comes to you in the original box. What a great gift this would make and it has a GREAT starting price. Price was marked $43.95 back in 1989 when the store went out of business. This item is very small and dainty. Would be suitable for a young girl. Buy it now!! I have eight other necklaces from the same shop at auction plus a pair of earrings.
