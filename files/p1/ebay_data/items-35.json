Jacquard weave emerald green satin with smooth black satin inserts flowing up the body from the thighs to the breasts and over the shoulders. Between the strap supports, the bones and the lacing up the back, your figure will look its best! Eleven spiral steel bones in the corset encourage good posture, adding inches to your height while the lacing subtracts inches from your waistline. The lacing is bi-directional. That means it laces from the bottom to the center and from the top to the center, putting the majority of the torque at the waist where you want it. Do your body and yourself a favor -- look sexy and feel great! Please read the sizing information below carefully. This wonderful corset is a size 36. The sizing refers to the approximate bust measurement. The waist will cinch tightly closed at 28\" or open up to as much as 34\". The satin panels do not stretch, so the waist is strictly confined between those two measurements. The bust measurement is a little more flexible, depending on how much bosom swell you want at the top. A 36D is going to look much more voluptuous than a 36B, for instance, but both could look sensational in this corset. Fourteen hook/eye sets fasten up the front. It measures 14\" along the center front. There are loops for garters if you want to wear stockings with it. The picture shows matching panties; you are bidding on the corset.

This gorgeous chain is 24\" long (beads and barrels are 6 mm wide) and weighs in about 30 grams of pure fine platinum with a pure platinum \"W Lock\" clasp. This is not filled or plated -- it is 100% solid pure fine platinum and is brand new! Pictures do not do this chain justice! It is a custom-designed unique chain. It is all Hand-Made custom jewlery. The chain is very strong. One of the many things that set this apart from any similar chain you might be able to find is that both ends of each hexagon 'barrel' link on this chain have been diamond cut -- this provides added shine and extra appeal. This (as all of my other jewelry for sale on ebay) is completely HAND-MADE -- giving the chain a more flexible and natural feel when you wear it. Most of the mass-produced neck chains have a stiff and rigid feeling when you wear them, mostly due to the links not being individually made(instead, they are cast in a mold -- this makes them much cheaper to make, but an inferior end product for you). Trust me, you will notice the \"flowing\" feel of this necklace the moment you put it on. This style necklace looks great by itself or with a pendant or charm -- you will definately get looks and compliments on this unique piece of custom jewelry. If you have any questions about this chain oe want additional pictures -- please feel free to contact me at LSIU99@aol.com Shipping on this item will be $15.

The fur is angora rabbit, so it is long and silky-soft. The collar may be worn down, or up to keep you warmer and give a more dramatic look. Long sleeves. The front closes with strong hooks. The jacket is fully-lined in luxurious champagne-colored satin. I don't know very much about fur coats so I am probably leaving out some important details here - please email me with your questions. The seams and workmanship appear to be excellently done, and the jacket is very nice and warm! I can find nothing wrong at all with the jacket, except that there are a couple spots on the lining, right below the label. I think they will come out with cleaning. The tag says, \"furrier method dry clean only\". Here are the measurements, which I took on the inside because the fur is too fluffy to give an accurate measurement: length = 23\", bust = 42\", hem (which falls just above or on the hips depending on torso length) = 44\". The sleeve from armpit to cuff is 17\". Tag says size Medium. Beautiful, and a perfect gift! The close-up picture most accurately shows the color, the top 2 are too dark. Auction policy: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!! I accept payment only via paypal, bidpay, and money order. I will take personal checks but I do not ship your item until your check clears (can take as long as 14 days depending on your bank). Payment is due WITHIN 10 DAYS of the end of the auction.

When you process your auction online at Paypal or Billpoint, please let us know the amount that we have quoted for postage.

The US Post Office will not allow a claim to be filed for a lost package until 60 days have passed, so please do not request that until after 60 days have passed.

Clinical Study Clinical Study : Longevity 4 (L-4) Conducted by Dr. Essman, Endocrinologist Date started on treatment: August 1, 1999 Date finished treatment: October 1, 1999 After 30 years of aging, levels of human growth hormone substantially decrease. Low levels of human growth hormone are directly associated with the many diseases associated with the aging process. Raised levels of HGH have produced health improvements and benefits. Dietary supplements composed of amino acids have been shown to promote the secretion of human growth hormone release. Pepsin has been shown to increase the amplitude and frequency of high release, in addition to amino acids. Argintine has been shown to diminish the effects of somatistatin, which is produced by the pituitary gland and inhibits human growth hormone from being distributed. Human growth hormone immediately changes into IGF-1 as we sleep. Increased IGF-1 levels indicate that human growth hormone have raised correspondingly. http://www.speerindustries.com/images/spray.jpg of HGH have produced health improvements and benefits.

HERE'S HOW IT WORKS: Your Maximum Bid Is Kept Secret, And It's Not Necessarily What You'll Pay. eBay Will Bid On Your Behalf (Which Is Called Proxy Bidding) By Steadily Increasing Your Bid By Small Increments Until Your Maximum Is Reached. Why bid by Proxy? Because It Means You Don't Have To Monitor The Auction As It Unfolds. You Also Don't Have To Worry About Being Outbid At The Very Last Minute Unless Someone Bids Over Your Maximum Dollar Amount. Want More Details? Check Out AN EXAMPLE OF PROXY BIDDING _ Choose Your Maximum Carefully, Though, As You Won't Be Able To Reduce It Later. Reserve Price Auction The reserve price is the lowest price a seller is willing to sell an item for. This amount is generally higher than the minimum bid. In order to win the auction, a bidder must meet or exceed the reserve price and have the highest bid. If no bidders meet the reserve price, neither the seller nor the high bidder are under any further obligation to complete the transaction.

These are VERY HARD TO FIND CARS!! What great cars to add to your collection. In recognition of Leno's love of cars, Mattel has created the Hot Wheels Legends Jay Leno Collection. The four die-cast cars selected for the series all represent vehicles that set a standard for cutting edge technology and eye-catching design, which is why they appealed to Leno in the first place. Cars featured in this auction are: Lamborghini Miura ~ This car was the original mid-engine Italian exotic car that combined trend-setting styling with high-performance technology and helped establish the reputation of Lamborghini, Jaguar XKE ~ Leno usually doesn't customize cars, but his Jaguar is an exception. The front end is from a 1972 XKE, while the rear portion is from a 1963 XKE. Shelby-Cobra Replica ~ Leno has always coveted the legendary 427 Shelby Cobra, but knowing that tracking down just the right example of this limited production car can be nearly impossible, he created his own version of this classic. Leno's version of this classic differs slightly from the stock version-it's powered by a 427 single overhead cam, which was used successfully in powerboat racing. Shelby Mustang GT350 ~ Leno has always been a big fan of Ford cars, so when a Ford-powered Cobra beat Ferrari at Le Mans, it was like a Super Bowl victory for Leno. This Shelby Mustang features the same engine. Are you starting your Christmas shopping early? These would make great gifts!! Winning bidder to pay $3.95 shipping (insurance optional).

Please note the following information. The first outfit is New Without the tags. I thought I would wear this on our September baby one day and then changed my mind thinking it wasn't worth wearing a new outfit and being cold all day. So, she never did get to wear it. It is a two piece set by Tiny Tots. Very soft. It has green, purple and white stripes. On the chest (on a white background) is a heart embroidered with the word, \"Love\" in the center. There are two bows on either side of the tummy. It has shorts that match. The second outfit is by Little Miracles. The bad news first...the top snap at the back of the neck is broken. All of the pieces are there, but the snap has come apart (if you've ever dealt with baby clothes, you know just what I'm talking about). If you're ingenius, I'm not, you would be able to fix it. The other way to get around is to not use the top snap. Anyway it's a very soft white two piece outfit with a little sleeveless top and matching romper pants. There are blue and pink flowers embroidered on the chest and a little satin bow attached. Really a sweet outfit. Too bad about the snap. Both outfits are size 3 - 6 months.
