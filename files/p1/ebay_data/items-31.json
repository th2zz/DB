This vest is brand new, never worn, and would make a very appreciated gift. Sorry for my poor photography--the vest is much prettier in real life. It's by Karen Stephens' \"Just A Few\" label. This is all hand made, and very well done. The material is very high quality specialty quilting material--some of it in subtle metallic gold. The theme is astronomy--sun, moon, stars, and clouds. It's fully lined. The front closes with an oriental style frog fastener. The vest is a slightly longer style you can wear over a blouse or simple dress. It's a size small--the bust measures 39\", and from the top of the shoulder to the bottom hem is 27\". Outstanding craftsmanship. You are getting a tremendous bargain here!

No puny bars of soap here. To ensure freshness, I make my soap in small batches here in my kitchen, in a small suburb of Chicago Illinois. My handcrafted soaps are made to retain ALL of their natural Glycerin. Glycerin occurs naturally in the soapmaking process and is very gentle and moisturizing to the skin. Commercial soap manufactures remove the natural Glycerin from their soap and sell it as a by-product, wich result in more profits for them but a drying bar of detergent for you. Most of the soap found today is full of detergents! Unlike commercial soap, my homemade soap is DETERGENT FREE!! While detergents are fine for washing the floor or cleaning the bathroom, they're hardly suitable for bathing or washing in. :) My handmade soap is made from a base of saponified vegtable oils, it does not contain animal products of any kind and is 100% cruelty free. It cleases gently while removing impuities and is not drying to your skin. It contains only the highest quality essential oils making it extremely moisturizing and luxurious. I add coconut Oil, Olive Oil, Palm Kernal Oil, Avacado Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Apricot Kernal Oil, and Vitamin E to every bar. It lathers up beautifully and rinses away cleanly. Simply put: My soaps are Fabulous! This soap features fun swirls and curls, squares and triangles inside a striking ice blue soap. It is scented with \"Peppermint Winterland\" fragrance oil. Unlike alot of the mind clearing, eye opening, nostril clearing peppermints out there, this one has a touch of sweetness to it, kind of like those ever popular little red and white candies. Peppermint is known to reduce fatigue and stress while increasing mental alertness. Personally, I like to take a bath with this soap before bed as I find the scent very relaxing. BOTTOM LINE: This peppermint is not too strong and not too sweet..its just right! All my soaps arrive in a cello bag tied with a decorative ribbon. Shipping : $3.95 for 1-10 bars. Please feel free to combine auctions to save on shipping. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information. Payment Instructions Satisfaction guaranteed. If you are not happy with my soap, please return it to me for a full refund.

My snood/hair jewelery with head band. It all started when my sister wanted a more fashionable way to put back her hair. Looking around at snoods and headbands gave me an idea! Very similar to a pattern from the forties,but of my own design. Now I have been getting requests and seemingly starting a trend! These snood/headbands are much better than your average scrunchie or headband. It is a combination of a snood(hair netting) and headband. The trouble with snoods is that you need to wear hair pins or combs to keep them in place. With my design,you can wear this exquisite piece with out the pins! It does not matter what length your hair is either! If you have short hair,it appears to be much longer due to the hanging netting.If you have long hair, it is kept neatly in place! GREAT way to hide a \"bad hair day\" or just to make a fashion statment!If you are in the food industry and need to put your hair back, no problem! This not only does a great job but it looks Fab! Great for that rennisance look as well! The added laced through accents can be easily removed. I intended it to be that way so that you could thread your own ribbon or andornments of your liking.Of course you could just keep them in as well making this unique head dress very versatile! My snood nettings are finished unlike most snoods out there so that the elastic cording is well hidden.If you need to adjust the cording carefully find the gold elastic tied end and retie it for a perfect custom fit! Each one of my snoods are carefully hand made. This design is black with shimmery silver accents woven into the headband. I call this one \"Black Ice\". Truly one of my favorites. You can wear black with anything! Ive choosen for the accents to the headband 2 rows of silver beading that bring out the woven silver of the headband. The pictures didnt catch how the light plays with this one! Ive included a picture of me in the multi-colored snood that is also up for auction so you can see what it looks like on a real head :)You are bidding on the black one in this auction. The design is the same. Look at my other auctions for more color choices! This headband measures 14 inches across and the netting hangs down about 9 inches. Shipping is $3.50 priority.If you prefer,I will ship first class. Insurance is available at an additional $1.10.I am not responsible for loss or damage if insurance is not purchased.International bidders email for a shipping quote.No handling fees just the cost of shipping. I will glady combine on shipping charges,Depending on the final weight. (2 headbands are still $3.50)International bidders please email me for a shipping quote.No hidden costs, just shipping. I accept Paypal,Billpoint or money orders. Sorry, NO personal checks! E-checks need to clear before shipping.(about 4 business days) I also request that my winning bidder contact me within 3 days of end of auction,and payment within 10 days of end of auction.THANKS FOR LOOKING AND HAPPY BIDDING! :)"}, {"ItemID": "1677481909", "Name": "2 NEW Zebra fur purses!

ATTENTION TEXAS RESIDENTS The state of Texas requires that I collect state and city taxes based on the buyer's shipping address in Texas. I feel that the additional 7.25-8.50 percent charge I would have to impose is unfair to Texans. When I purchase items over the net, I avoid Texas sellers to prevent being taxed. For me, selling to Texas residents is not worth the additional hastle of computing city/state taxes, maintaining records, and dealing with the state. For these reasons, I intend to only sell outside the state of Texas. One of the biggest advantages of purchasing through the Internet is not having to pay tax, it rubs me the wrong way to do so. I can not legally sell to Texans without taxing them so the only other option I have is to not sell to residents of Texas. I sure hope my fellow Texans understand and can find similar bargains from non Texas based dealers. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HIGH BIDDER pays $15.00 shipping & handling cost within the continental USA.

We use all natural ingredients, olive oil, and vegetable fats, and pure essential oils and/or manufacture grade fragrance oils for fragrance. Our soap will last 3-4 times longer than commercially store bought soap, will not goo up in your soap dish, and will still give you that smooth, clean, moisturized skin your looking for. Its mild enough to use on sensitive skin, and has healing properties for problem skin. The fragrances are pleasant, not over powering, so you can enjoy while using it, and not walk away smelling like it. This will not dry out your skin! Try it, you will feel the difference. We can ship as many as 9 bars for $3.95 shipping. So you might want to check our other soap auctions. Our soaps are all handmade by our family, hand cut and wrapped by us. Buyer pays $3.95 priority shipping. For International shipping, email us for rates. Payment accepted in US FUNDS ONLY!! Paypal, Billpoint, Bidpay, Cash, Money Orders. NO PERSONAL CHECKS!
