I ordered it as my 10 year gift figuring my wife would use it. She never did. It remained in the closet for years, never having so much as a pencil put in it. It is made by the Hazel company and is 17\"W X 12\"H X 2\" thick with a 2 3/4\" X 3/4\" Cray Research, Inc emblem attached to one face. Expands to about 3\". The two outer compartments are open, and the inner is zippered. All three are satin lined. Inside the inner compartment are pockets for small flat objects, loops for two pens, and a private zippered pouch. The outer compartments hide two handles which extend 3 1/2\" beyond the 12\" height. There's also a 40\" strap with leather shoulder pad that clips to either end of the case. A very nice gift indeed. Still has that new leather smell.

HOLIDAY SHIPPING OPTIONS FOR THE USA We ship almost everything using the US Post Office. If the shipping charge stated is less than $3.50, the item is shipped via first class mail which is normally 2 to 4 days to anywhere in the USA. There is no delivery confirmation available on this and packages in rare instances have taken up to two weeks to arrive (way less than 1% of the time). Past history in shipping tells us that the Post Office actually does a very good job in December, yet with the volume of mail they process, packages do sometimes get misrouted. All items with a stated shipping charge of $3.50 or more are already shipped via priority mail, most with a delivery confirmation. Priority mail shipping with a delivery confirmation number sent to you is available on any item we sell where the shipping charge is stated at under $3.50. The cost for this is $4 and applies to the ties and most of the small ornaments that we are selling. If you want this service just submit $4 in place of any lower shipping amount stated and we will ship priority mail. Express mail overnight shipping is also available at a cost of $13.00 up to 8 ounces (single ties), 8 ounces to 2 pounds at $17 (most plates) and 2 to 3 pounds, $20. This is guaranteed overnight to most of the USA but may take two days to more rural areas. If you want to use this service have your payment in by noon CST or call me at 847-924-8744 and I will let you know if I will be able to get the item out that day.

From the \"Intelligent Design Group,\" @ David Shire Collectibles! P.S. The Bell-cap on the large, black, terminal pearl, is subtly different than the one pictured, but JUST as pleasing to the EYE, if not MORE SO! ATTENTION CONTINENTAL U.S. BIDDERS: PLEASE NOTE WELL: All winnings are shipped via USPS \"Priority Mail.\" The base charge, for any shipment, is $6.00, to cover Shipping, Handling & Insurance, for winnings valued at $50.00 or less, and weighing 1 lb. or less. Add a $1.00 for winnings valued at $51.00 to $100.00 and add a $1.00 for winnings weighing over 1 lb. to, no more than, 2 lbs. A shipment valued at $60.00, and weighing 1.5 lbs. would, therefore, incur a charge of $8.00. Winnings that lay outside of these basic parameters will be addressed on an individual basis. If each shipment was processed as prescribed by each winner, Handling Charges would become cost prohibitory. From our experience and pollings, the above shipping methods have proved to be the most equitable, the most cost efficient, the most dependable, and the most expeditious, means available in the marketplace, today. Thank you for your understanding in this matter. ATTENTION INTERNATIONAL BIDDERS If you succeed in winning this auction, before drawing any bank checks, making payment via *PayPal or any other, viable Transfer Medium, PLEASE, let us know that you ARE an International winner, and from which COUNTRY you \"HAIL,\" so that we can let you know, via e-mail, what choices you have in transport medium and associated charges. EVERY COUNTRY is DIFFERENT, based upon the DISTANCE involved in TRANSPORT. Shipping and insurance fees are NOT EXPENSIVE; for EXAMPLE, six ounces, via \"SMALL PACKET,\" Airmail is only $7.30 to AUSTRALIA- add an additional $7.25 for Insurance to cover up to $50.00 in value, if desired. Six ounces, via SMALL PACKET \"Slow-boat,\" (4 to 6 weeks) is only $6.05 to Australia; the SAME insurance rate applies. Obviously, a 1-pound shipment is priced at a REASONABLE, but higher RATE. AGAIN, PLEASE wait for a quote, before expending any time and energy on acquiring Bank Checks & Money Orders, or arranging payment, via any Transfer Medium. Thank you! We accept and encourage the USE of Money Orders, Personal & Bank Checks but also welcome PayPal PAYMENTS, _Western Union-BidPay Money Orders,_ and ship, almost invariably, upon receipt of funds.

Perfectly tailored, and measuring 9 inches by 5 1/2 inches, this bag is made of a heavy black silk taffeta. The \"strap\" is also silk taffeta, with a heavy whipped edge, to look rather like a braid, and with a maximum drop-length of 14 inches. Actually the strap measures longer than 28 inches, because it starts at one corner inside the bag and runs across the interior before continuing up over the shoulder and down to meet the handsome knotted fringe tassel, which is actually formed by the ends of the strap, and is attached inside. The strap length can be adjusted on the inside, so the bag can be carried as with a short strap; or the bag can be used as a pouch, with the strap tucked away inside. The bag is about 1/2 inch wide, but will expand nicely (actually to 4 inches, but you probably wouldn't want it to go out that far). The label is \"Morris Muskowitch - Made in USA\". Inside is a small zipper pocket, and an open \"comb-pocket\". I'm sorry the pictures are so dark; I tried to edit them lighter; the black is a very dense, dark black. Isn't it fun to carry something with truly fine detailing? Especially when it's so pretty to look at!
