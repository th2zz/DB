Director: Dan Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez Anyone who has even the slightest trouble with insomnia after seeing a horror movie should stay away from The Blair Witch Project--this film will creep under your skin and stay there for days. Credit for the effectiveness of this mock documentary goes to filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who armed three actors (Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Josh Leonard) with video equipment, camping supplies, and rough plot outlines. They then let the trio loose into the Maryland woods to improvise and shoot the entire film themselves as the filmmakers attempted to scare the crap out of them. Gimmicky, yes, but it worked--to the wildly successful tune of $130 million at the box office upon its initial release (the budget was a mere $40,000). For those of you who were under a rock when it first hit the theaters, The Blair Witch Project tracks the doomed quest of three film students shooting a documentary on the Burkittsville, Maryland, legend of the Blair Witch. After filming some local yokels (and providing only scant background on the witch herself), the three, led by Heather (something of a witch herself), head into the woods for some on-location shooting. They're never seen again. What we see is a reconstruction of their \"found\" footage, edited to make a barely coherent narrative. After losing their way in the forest, whining soon gives way to real terror as the three find themselves stalked by unknown forces that leave piles of rocks outside their campsite and stick-figure art projects in the woods. (As Michael succinctly puts it, \"No redneck is this clever!\") The masterstroke of the film is that you never actually see what's menacing them; everything is implied, and there's no terror worse than that of the unknown. If you can wade through the tedious arguing--and the shaky, motion-sickness-inducing camerawork--you'll be rewarded with an oppressively sinister atmosphere and one of the most frightening denouements in horror-film history. Even after you take away the monstrous hype, The Blair Witch Project remains a genuine, effective original.

The audio is in Japanese with Dolby Digital AC-3 5.1 Surround. This DVD is an original DVD, BRAND NEW NEVER USED, it is not a vcd, cd-r copy or bootleg. This DVD includes 1 DVD in box. As I was watching this series, I was struck by how similar it was to \"Sailor Moon\" -- they're both targeted towards the same pre-teen girl audience, they're both heavy on the magic and romance, and they have very similar character designs. That's why it's so hard to believe how much better than \"Sailor Moon\" \"Card Captor Sakura\" is! Though sometimes the story seems repetitive, the animation is just incredible, especially for a tv series. Whereas in \"Sailor Moon\", you can tell that they're trying to get away with as little animation as possible, \"Sakura\" is almost lush enough to be put on the big screen. All of the super-cheesy stuff that sometimes made me embarrassed to watch \"Sailor Moon\" is totally gone. Plus it has better character development, Sakura gets to wear a different battle costume each episode, and there could not possibly be any anime character cuter than Kero-chan. Now, unfortunately, \"Card Captor Sakura\" is not yet officially available in the US. This is a series that I highly recommend.

High quality full-size ABS polymer and metal replica of the new pistol design from Walther_, makers of the PPK compact pistol. The P99 is a state-of-the-art autopistol. The P99 has been issued to Agent 007, James Bond . It is James Bond's new sidearm in Tomorrow Never Dies TND, & The World is not Enough TWINE. High quality model has authentic details and is built to scale. Working slide, trigger, magazine and release. There is full-length slide travel on this replica, and the slide stop actually works. Slide automatically locks at rear with an empty magazine, just like a real P99 . Authentic shell ejection port. Realistic removable magazine. Functioning firing pin striker with red dot indicator. Ambidextrous magazine release. Open combat sights. Fine surface texturing, including slide grooves, finger grooves, and non-slip grip surfaces. Color is black, and the finish appears as the genuine article. Length is about 7 inches. This is a gas blowback gun, made by Y & P. When loaded, it will fire 14 shots as fast as you pull the trigger. When the first magazine is empty, slam in the second one and just keep shooting. The slide blows back with every shot! Pistol comes NEW, mint in box with instructions, 100 .2gr BB's, and 2 removable full size clips. Just add gas for everything you need to start having fun! This P99 is one of the most realistic and most detailed replicas available. In fact, many movies and TV Series actually use guns such as these as back up and throw down pieces because of their detail and inexpensive nature. Why destroy a $500 steel blank firing prop when you can have the same amount of detail at well less than half the cost? This replica is composed of tough ABS polymer and metal parts. Do not confuse this with the Tomorrow Never Dies P99 cap gun toy made by Wicke! This is a truly accurate scaled model with the high quality details of the true Walther_ P99 . The top picture is a real P99 . The bottom picture is of this gun. It cannot fire real bullets, and never could. This baby will fool your friends for sure!

In Hollywood as extra from 1936 (age 18), she won a Warner Brothers contract in 1937, which ended after 15 films as bit player and Busby Berkeley chorine. Her \"break\" came when Hal Roach cast her in the skin-clad lead of his hit 'One Million B.C. (1940)' and in 3 fine comedies, then sold her contract to 20th Century Fox. She played \"B\" leads and \"A\" supporting roles in her first 12 Fox films, with a notable dramatic performance in 'I Wake Up Screaming (1941)'. Critics dwelled on her beauty, seldom mentioning her acting and comedy potential. Unusual Woman A feminist at a young age, she once tried to start a girls football at school but got into trouble because it was considered \"un-lady like\" Two older siblings: Dorothy Ridste Ross, born 1917, and Lawrence Ridste. Carole protested strongly and publicly against the nonsensical nickname 'Ping Girl' coined by Hal Roach publicist Frank Seltzer.in April 1940. In her musicals, Carole usually sang in her own voice. A keen amateur photographer, she developed her own pictures. She initiated divorce proceedings against her last husband in March 1948 but the divorce was not final when she died. NO RESERVE UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE Carole wrote a book about her first wartime USO tour, entertaining troops in England and North Africa; in the film version, 'Four Jills in a Jeep (1944)', we first glimpse her mature talent. Absent most of that year on USO work in the Pacific, she returned weakened by amoebic dysentery, malaria, and near-fatal pneumonia to find the film dismissed as \"self-praise\". After 'Having Wonderful Crime (1945)', perhaps her best comedy, and two B-films, her Fox contract was dropped. Ostracized in Hollywood due to her ardent feminism and rumors about sexual episodes, she made her last two films in England. With a stalled career, health poor, marriages failed, short of money, and the end in sight of a love affair with married Rex Harrison she committed suicide with Seconal in 1948. Intelligent, generous, talented and gorgeous, she was 29.

THE CRITERION COLLECTION IS PROUD TO PRESENT A SPECIAL EDITION PRESTON STURGES' THE LADY EVE BARBARA STANWYCK HENRY FONDA CHARLES COBURN WILLIAM DEMAREST LUCILLE BALL ONCE SAID SHE LEARNED ABOUT PERFORMING COMEDY IN FILM BY STUDYING STANWYCK IN \"THE LADY EVE\" THIS EDITION IS UNRATED ROGER EBERT, Chicago Sun-Times: \"If I were asked to name the single scene in the history of romantic comedy that was sexiest and funniest at the same time, I would advise beginning at six seconds past the 20-minute mark in Preston Sturges' The Lady Eve, and watching as Barbara Stanwyck toys with Henry Fonda's hair in an unbroken shot that lasts three minutes and 51 seconds. \"Stanwyck [gives] one of her greatest performances, a flight of romance and comedy so graceful and effortless that she is somehow able to play different notes at the same time. \"As good as Fonda is, The Lady Eve is all Stanwyck's; the love, the hurt and the anger of her character provide the motivation for nearly every scene, and what is surprising is how much genuine feeling she finds in the comedy. \"The Stanwyck character's masquerade sets up the two final lines of the film, which I will not mention here-- except to say that for my money, either one is equal to the classic line \"nobody's perfect!\" at the end of \"Some Like It Hot.\" TV GUIDE: \"THE LADY EVE is one of Sturges' best romantic comedies, with just the right blend of satire and slapstick, the laughs coming mostly from his clever, often inspired comedic lines. His direction is flawless, and the cast, from stars to stock players, performs beautifully. Stanwyck, is particular, is an effortless comedienne. \"It's a daring, roguish display of her talent; one can't imagine any comedienne-- even Colbert or Russell--bringing it off as she does. Sturges, who began as a contract scriptwriter for Paramount, promised Stanwyck that he would write a great comedy for her some day, and she got it.\" TOM DIRKS, The Greatest Films: \"The Lady Eve is a sophisticated romantic/sex comedy (with light romance and mock seduction scenes) - a classic screwball film, a quintessential Preston Sturges work of art and the director's first real commercial hit. \"Barbara Stanwyck proves, once and for all, she stands tallest among the great film comediennes.\" LEONARD MALTIN: \"Stanwyck is a con artist who sets her eyes on wealthy Fonda-- the dolt to end all dolts, who proclaims \"snakes are my life.\" \"This film grows funnier with each viewing-- thanks to Sturges's script, breathless pace, and two incomparable stars.\" DIALOGUE Charles Pike (Fonda): You ought to put handles on that skull. Maybe you could grow geraniums in it. ------------------------- Charles Pike: You're certainly a funny girl for anybody to meet who's just been up the Amazon for a year. Jane Harrington (Stanwyck): Good thing you weren't up there two years. ------------------------- Jane Harrington: You see Hopsi, you don't know very much about girls. The best ones aren't as good as you think they are and the bad ones aren't as bad. Not nearly as bad. ------------------------- Charles Pike: What I am trying to say is: I'm not a poet, I'm an ophiologist. ------------------------- Jane Harrington: You know Charles? Sir Alfred McGlennan (Eric Blore): Oh, is he the tall backwards boy always toying with toads and things? Yes, I think I have seen him scouting about. Jane Harrington: He's not backwards. He's a scientist. Sir Alfred McGlennan: Oh is that what it is? I knew he was, mm... peculiar. ------------------------- Jane Harrington: Boy, would I like to see you give some old harpie the thrill! \"Colonel\" Harrington (Charles Coburn): Don't be vulgar, Jane. Let us be crooked, but never common. ------------------------- Jane Harrington: I don't see why I have to do all the dirty work. There must be plenty of rich old dames waiting for you to push them around. \"Colonel\" Harrington: You find them, I'll push them. ------------------------- Jane Harrington: I need him like the ax needs the turkey. ------------------------- The Stewart: Good morning, sir.

Thousands died while peace negotiators awaited the outcome of the battle to determine strength at the bargaining table. The hill's value was that it had no value, becoming purely an extraordinary test of wills.

He has a polished grace that serves here to suggest evil dimensions just beneath the surface. \"I also enjoyed, in a visceral way, the pleasures of seeing the visual beauties of a Western. The choreography of a gunfight in rocky foothills. The excitement of a chase on horseback. The ambushes and close calls and treks through the desert land. \"'Quigley Down Under' is a handsome, well-acted film.\" TODD GORMAN, StarFilm Reviews: \"Quigley Down Under is a very pleasant surprise. Essentially it_s a Western with Tom Selleck as the eponymous hero who takes himself to the Australian Outback like a cowboy Crocodile Dundee in reverse. There is an offbeat quirky love story too. \"With his neatly trimmed beard, cowboy hat and huge six-foot rifle, Quigley cuts a very imposing dash when he steps off the boat in Western Australia. \"It_s the 1860s and he_s been hired after answering a newspaper advertisement looking for _the best long-distance sharpshooter in the world_. \"This is a hugely enjoyable film with all kinds of traditional heroic resonances. \"An authoritative Selleck is wholeheartedly into his role as a laconic but highly moral Western hero. \"Lots of spectacular rugged landscapes, an uplifting musical score and some perfectly judged dramatic moments complete a movie which manages to be very entertaining.\" QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER SPECIAL WIDESCREEN EDITION NOT THE STANDARD RELEASE DIGITALLY MASTERED AUDIO & ANAMORPHIC VIDEO WIDESCREEN PRESENTATION 2.35:1 ENHANCED FOR 16x9 TVs DOLBY DIGITAL SURROUND SOUND \"THE REBIRTH OF THE WESTERN\" FEATURETTE ORIGINAL TV SPOTS ORIGINAL THEATRICAL TRAILER FRENCH AND SPANISH SOUNDTRACKS, IF DESIRED CLOSE CAPTIONED (For the deaf and hearing impaired) FRENCH AND SPANISH SUBTITLES, IF DESIRED SCENE SELECTIONS Click on the links below for samples of the dialogue in Quigley Down Under May seem shaky for a few moments - Give them time - They're Fun!

Winters Editor Synopsis Eager to experience it all, three sailors are determined to find love and adventure during their 24-hour leave in New York City. Carrying with them good hearts, great voices, and delightful dance steps, the navy men encounter and charm lovely ladies and colorful characters. ON THE TOWN is a classic musical that perfectly balances song with story, love with camaraderie while showing off the remarkable dancing of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra_s unforgettable voice. Description Codirectors Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen (SINGIN_ IN THE RAIN) also choreographed this musical classic following three sailors docked in New York City for 24 hours. New to town and ready to see the sights--and the girls--Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Jules Munshin search for adventure in the Big Apple. Wooing the ladies with their singing and dancing and being charmed in return, the trio finds various degrees of romantic success. But as all good things must come to an end, the navy men return to their ship, leaving behind them a city briefly brighter and taking with them a heartful of memories. Dancing by the marvelous and masculine Kelly and singing by heartthrob Sinatra (looking very young!) add punch and pizzazz to the musical numbers, including the famous \"New York, New York\" scene. ON THE TOWN was one of the first movies filmed on location in New York--a wild extravagance in those days--and the extra effort taken shows in every shot of the film. Film Notes The film contains remarkable location footage of New York City. Shooting outside of the studio was a rarity at that time, and Gene Kelly had to fight for permission to do so. As it was, the crew had to be careful about when and where they shot given the stars' fame--especially Sinatra's. The film is based on the Broadway musical, which premiered in December 1944; that show, in turn, was inspired by Jerome Robbins's short ballet, \"Fancy Free.\" Among the stars of the show were ballerina Sono Osato (as Ivy Smith), the play's writers Betty Comden and Adolph Green (as Claire and Ozzy), and Nancy Walker (as Hildy). It was a first for most of the show's young cast and creators, the majority of whom had not yet celebrated their 30th birthdays: It marked the Broadway debut for choreographer Robbins, composer Leonard Bernstein, and playwrights Comden and Green. Only director George Abbott was a theater veteran. ON THE TOWN was also a first in other respects--most importantly, as the first Broadway musical to have an interracial chorus and to employ a black conductor/musical director. Reportedly, when Louis B. Mayer, head of MGM, saw the show (which he had already bought the movie rights to), he considered it \"communist\" because of a duet danced by an interracial couple. Much of Leonard Bernstein's Broadway score was scrapped for the film, which ultimately contained only four of his original songs. New songs were written by Roger Edens. MGM was not alone in wanting the film rights to ON THE TOWN. In fact, Mayer and the other executives had to wrench them from another studio, which had already purchased them. This was the first time that a bidding war had erupted prior to a Broadway show's opening; most of the interest was generated by the popularity of Jerome Robbins's ballet.

It is a VHS NTSC video which came from a WB station, Not from the store. This was given to stations for promotions. Rare because the shows haven_t been fully edited for air. In _Pangs_ (Buffy) and in _I Will Remember You\" (Angel) the fight scenes have not had all the audio added yet. Which makes it kind funny to watch and not hear punching or swords clanging ect. ect. . The same is for all the special effects. They are there, but they are not finished yet. And you can see some really bad green screen effects shots where the final ones will go. Watch buffys hand disappear and reappears and the vampire she kills fall forward and disappear (with out the skeleton_s falling apart) in the tease before the show starts. Buffy doesn_t have credits on the end instead it has a slate shot that says credits 30 sec. And Angles credits are x out with a big red x as well as some of the special effects. The cassette doesn_t have a logo on it. It has a white label with Buffy The Vampire Slayer/Angel, Special Two Hour Event, Tuesday, November 23 1999, (8:00-10:00pm et), TRT (Total running time) 90:20 It comes in the original cassette box that came to the station. It_s a cheaper plastic then normal because these were Intended to be thrown away or recycled and taped over. Full color insert with a picture of buffy and Angel with the show logos and on the top it says, A spectacular Two-Hour Event that Reunites Buffy and Angel. On the bottom it has each of them as special guests for each show. The air date of Tuesday, November 23 and the show times. This is great item for any Buffy / Angel collector.

The two people who see through him the most are Dern,and a local journalist,who having lost limbs in war hates railroads and ambitous people.Kind of like the old Hamilton vs Jefferson;Hamilton represnting big banking and progress-while others dont like it they know its the way of the future.Many people dident like RxR's either. Bruce Dern is the outlaw Strawhorn,with a great understanding of human nature.Evidence of this is in the scence where just after shooting someone,in front of a horrified crowd,he shuts up a barking dog by throwing him a pice of meat.always trying to cloud good and evil,one of his most memorble quotes is when he tells Nightingale:'honest men only stay honest til it stops paying,thats why your a liar and Im a theif.' Nightingales' plan is simple:elimiate strawhorns gang, and to get elected-capture Strawhorn himself- simple plan but he finds it not as simple to carry out. After a member of Nightingales own posse ponders his future because he is an indian(Indians were often hired by the white man often performing beyond expectations but once the mission was over they were left out to dry)sets the scence to the climatic ending-its Stawhorn vs Nightingale: a chess match playing itself out to the end! Another quote I liked was 'what do we pay taxes for?' If you never saw this movie before try starting it 105 minutes into the movie then watch it again. Another offbeat Kirk Douglas western I would recomend is 'Lonely are the brave' with walter Mathau as sheriff. Shipping and Handling $2.75"}, {"ItemID": "1496265347", "Name": "Signed 3 x 5 - M.

Otherwise, I would never have picked this ledger up- ledgers are pretty boring, as a rule. This is pretty interesting, though. It lists all the expenses for a movie theater for the peiod 1927-1929. There is no ticket sales information. For example, Miss S. Dorfman received 8.00 per week as cashier and E.H. Dowding received 20.00 per week as organist. The best pages are those that list the movie rentals. Films were obtained from Fox, Plathe, Universal, MGM and other agencies. Fees ran from 2.00 to 20.00. This was a pretty low budget theater, because the majority of films were the inexpensive serials and curiosities. But most the big names seem to appear somewhere- Our Gang, Hoot Gibson, Tom Mix, Rudolph Valentino, Wallace Beery, Douglas Fairbanks and on and on. This was pretty much a shoe-string operation and not much record keeping was done. There are about 250 pages and only about 40 have been written on. The most writing has to do with the movies and many of these pages have been written on both sides. Only a true devotee will recognize many of the cheaper titles. My photo shows the best page and I think almost everyone is familiar with the stars and titles. There is no personal, business or theater name in the ledger. I found the 2 playbills in the same box. They were the only similar items in the box, but that is no guarantee that they are related, except the items seemed to be personal effects rather than a collection. I could not match up any rental information with the playbill dates. The playbills are for the Gayety Theater located at 2407 Central Avenue. There is no city listed. The listed movies are some of the better known films and actors including Charlie Chaplin in 'The Circus' and Victor McLaglen in 'Strong Boy.' Matinees were on Sunday with candy for the children. The playbills are in very poor condition- the edges are all damaged. The ledger is basically pretty good, but has surface soil. These are heavy, so shipping will be approximately 8-10.00 depending on destination. PLease contct me with any questions. Thank you for looking. NO PAYPAL ON SALES UNDER 25.00.
