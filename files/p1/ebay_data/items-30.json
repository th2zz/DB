These look incredible with jeans and the yellow sticthing and navy blue colors complement each other very well. This is just an all around good looking shoe! HERE'S THE SCOOP ON THE SIZE: For those of you familiar with Dr. Martens sizing, these run the same as most other Docs . For those of you who are new to the Doc Martin crowd, the inside of the shoe is 10 1/4 inches long and the sole is 11 3/4 inches long. I wear a US Womens 9.5 and the UK 7 US Mens 8 US Womens 9 in this style fits me great, so these run slightly large compared to US sizes. Check the measurement to be sure before placing your bid because everyone's foot is unique and I DO NOT ACCEPT RETURNS (costly to you and time consuming for me). If you are not sure about your size, just email me and I can help you decide what size you will need. There are a few things we can do to insure that you order the correct size. IF YOU HAVE NEVER HAD DOCS BEFORE: I strongly suggest that you head to the mall and try some on - then come back to me and save a bundle. Be SURE that if you are buying boots, try on a pair of boots, if you are buying sandals try on a pair of sandals, etc. Most docs run the same, but some of my customers have found a discrepancy in the sizing from different types of shoes. Again, everyone's foot is different. I haven't found this to be the case with my size, but it is ALWAYS better to be safe than sorry.

GREAT DAY!!!!! Start shopping for Christmas to avoid delay in deliveries and.... make purchases now and save on the perfect GIFT!!!! Please check my other auctions for wonderful gifts to your love ones!!!!!!! Buy From eBay Powersellers!!! please visit my ebay store for more rare designer items! Thank you!!! I want to thank everyone for their comments/suggestions/helps/supports in finding me a solution to solve the matter of other users from copying my pics! Thank you to all the wonderful people on the net! I want to say sorry to other wonderful people that try to help me and i did not email back, Thank you too! ****First of all this message is for the ebay and yahoo sellers!!!**** ***Dear EBay/Yahoo Sellers~ Please stop copying my pictures or copying word for word from my auctions to post on your auctions. Please provide your own pictures and auction description, because I would not like bidders to confuse all of us as of one seller. And please make this easier for all of us. I'm the original owner of these pictures! Thank you! Warning! Dear Bidders please be careful when bidding for name brand stuff especially Popular name items. The best way to find out is to take it to the Boutique or places that sells them. If you have any question on this please feel free to email me, I will be very glad to help you!!! OK! First of all, i want to make sure that you understand this is for an 100% Authentic Newest 2001 collection and one of the Hottest TIFFANY item -- ****TIFFANY 925 Pure Stealing Silver Venetian Link Bracelet!!!*** This auction will include the gift box w/ lid and white ribbon, the care card, and the famous powder blue dust pouch!!!! Measures 7.5\" inches long, perfect for everyone!!! If this is too long for you then you can bring it back to Tiffany and have them adjust/cut it to your wrist size. Feel lucky if you have one!!! It is Brand New, and never been used!!!!! Give it out as a gift or keep it!!! This is a great piece for your love one!!! All Time Sold out! Popular piece!!!! Suprise Chanel sample will also be included in this auction!!! I notice that there are many fakes out there and i do not want to be mistaken as one of them. If i listed 'authentic', it means that i purchased personally at an authentic retailer. And if you see 'authenticity not guaranteed' that means it is 100% FAKE or a good copy! So why pay so much for a fake item, when just a little more you can get an authentic item??? Besides, if later on when you decide you don't want it anymore, the Authentic designer item would still has it's value vs. no one would care for fake bags!!! Please Think!!!! It is not worth it to get fakes! This is a perfect to go with my other TIFFANY or other Sterling Silver by Gu*ci auctions(please check out my other auctions). It is the perfect set to go out with!!! I don't think i need to tell you more about this, look at the pictures and see for yourself. Feel free to email me if you have any questions, please don't email me and ask if it is authentic, because it is 100% guaranteed Authentic!!!!! Winner please add $7 for Shipping & Insurance.

We suggest the following guidelines: 1._Select a seller with a good reputation (see feedback) 2._Be specific about the date you need the item when you send payment. 3._If using a credit card select a seller with a secure server. 4._Ask questions before you bid. 5._Inquire about refund policy. 6._Check seller's shipping rates. 7._Bid early. We have been selling for over five years on eBay. Together we have more than 3000 positive feedback points. We guarantee our merchandise to be as advertised and welcome queries regarding it. We pack and ship carefully without inflated shipping charges. Enjoy shopping on line confidently. ___ Meredith & Dana S. Whaley ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ AUCTION CLOSING FAQ: 1. We ship in the order in which we receive payment unless there is an emergency request. 2. We ship twice a week. As a result, Buy It Now does not automatically mean Ship It Now. 3. Money Orders are treated the same as checks and do not speed delivery. We prefer checks because should they be lost in the mail they are far easier for the buyer to trace. 4. We do not, as so many others do, charge $4 & $5 on shipping small items such as jewelry and we do not send jewelry Priority unless requested in an attempt to save our buyers money. 5. We recommend insurance for all items and will not be held for damage or non-delivery of uninsured items. 6. Postal Claims: Insured items do have a guarantee against damage or non-delivery. For damaged items it is necessary for the buyer to present the packaging and the item to the Post Office to begin the claim. For non-delivered items we will file a trace/claim with the Post Office and the Post Office will then reimburse the buyer for qualifying claims. 7. Please read our e-mail and follow our instructions for the fastest possible shipping. 8. Please include your item #, e-mail address and shipping address so we can serve you promptly and give you positive feedback on receipt of payment. No item is sent out broken unless advertised as damaged. We recommend insurance to protect the buyer. We make every effort to advertise items fairly and do not refund for buyer s remorse. If there is some question about an item arrangements for possible refund need to be made in advance of shipment. We are sorry, but we can no longer issue refunds for clothing.

I do not know the origin of this top except it looks like someone might have made it themselves. It's well made actually. The material is shimmery and ever so slightly furry. It's just a little too long and big for me. There is black lace around the top. It seems to be in good condition from what I can tell. It's probably a Large or Extra Large by my guess. Would look really cute with some dark cuffed jeans. Shipping will be $3.50 with priority mail (2-3 day delivery). I accept money orders from all, and personal checks from users with 30+ positive feedback. You are resonsible for any bank fees due to a bounced personal check, so please do not write any bad checks :( You'll have to pay any and all bank fees. I have to wait 7 days for the check to clear before mailing the item. I ship to the United States only. I think that covers it all, any questions, please ask me :) Thanks much for looking at my auction, and check out my other auctions for more cool clothes as I am in the process of cleaning out my closet!

ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE ASK BEFORE BIDDING. BUYER IS TO PAY SHIPPING AND HANDLING OF $10.00 FOR PRIORITY MAIL. INSURANCE IS UP TO BUYER. I PACK WELL AS MY FEEDBACK WILL SHOW BUT I CANT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PACKAGE HANDLING OR LOSS OF PACKAGE BY THE POST OFFICE. I ACCEPT MONEY ORDERS, CASHIERS CHECK AND PAYPAL. CHECKS ARE DISCOURAGED BUT WILL BE ACCEPTED. SHIPPING WILL BE DELAYED AT LEAST 10 BUSINESS DAYS FROM WHEN I RECEIVE THE CHECK. I DO NOT SHIP ON WEEKENDS, SO PAYMENT REACHING ME ON FRIDAY WILL BE MAILED ON MONDAY! THANKS FOR YOUR INTEREST. I Pledge Allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."}]}
