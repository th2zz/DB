And thats who were talking about here. Maybe you can remember the words to the popular theme song from this wonderful show of a bygone era, but I'm drawing some blanks. This is a Mr Ed. talking hand puppet. Complete with his working voice box. Made by Mattel , in 1962. Good overall condition. Rubber on face area is not dried or cracked and is still supple, with nice features . Cloth fur like neck, is not torn, and is still soft. Yarn like mane is still in good condition. The voice box and pull string is original, and is working. He says several different phrases. He still has a good sharp detailed Mattel tag on his seam. He could use a careful cleaning, because of his age. A wonderful vintage toy to display and show off this holiday season.

We suggest the following guidelines: 1._Select a seller with a good reputation (see feedback) 2._Be specific about the date you need the item when you send payment. 3._If using a credit card select a seller with a secure server. 4._Ask questions before you bid. 5._Inquire about refund policy. 6._Check seller's shipping rates. 7._Bid early. We have been selling for over five years on eBay. Together we have more than 3000 positive feedback points. We guarantee our merchandise to be as advertised and welcome queries regarding it. We pack and ship carefully without inflated shipping charges. Enjoy shopping on line confidently. ___ Meredith & Dana S. Whaley ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ AUCTION CLOSING FAQ: 1. We ship in the order in which we receive payment unless there is an emergency request. 2. We ship twice a week. As a result, Buy It Now does not automatically mean Ship It Now. 3. Money Orders are treated the same as checks and do not speed delivery. We prefer checks because should they be lost in the mail they are far easier for the buyer to trace. 4. We do not, as so many others do, charge $4 & $5 on shipping small items such as jewelry and we do not send jewelry Priority unless requested in an attempt to save our buyers money. 5. We recommend insurance for all items and will not be held for damage or non-delivery of uninsured items. 6. Postal Claims: Insured items do have a guarantee against damage or non-delivery. For damaged items it is necessary for the buyer to present the packaging and the item to the Post Office to begin the claim. For non-delivered items we will file a trace/claim with the Post Office and the Post Office will then reimburse the buyer for qualifying claims. 7. Please read our e-mail and follow our instructions for the fastest possible shipping. 8. Please include your item #, e-mail address and shipping address so we can serve you promptly and give you positive feedback on receipt of payment. No item is sent out broken unless advertised as damaged. We recommend insurance to protect the buyer. We make every effort to advertise items fairly and do not refund for buyer s remorse. If there is some question about an item arrangements for possible refund need to be made in advance of shipment. We are sorry, but we can no longer issue refunds for clothing.
