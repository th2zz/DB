Three separate but interconnected stories, all set on a deceptively sunny day in California and centered around one million dollars in cash, inspire Hoch's quirky characters to commit acts both devious and depraved in an attempt to make the big score.

About The Lucy Show Tackling a series on her own, without husband Desi Arnaz, Lucille Ball firmly established herself as the first lady of American television with this long-running series. With one exception, the supporting cast underwent numerous changes over the years, and at one time included both of Miss Balls real-life children. The one exception was Gale Gordon, who provided Lucy with a stubborn, stuffy foil for most of the shows run. The real constant, however, was Lucy and her special brand of slapstick humor, played off of all sorts of guests and regulars. About Our Products Each week we list hundreds of cds, videos and dvds.

Robinson, Arthur Loft, Dan Duryea, Jess Barker, Joan Bennett, Margaret Lindsay, Rosalind Ivan, Samuel S. Hinds Film Credits Fritz Lang Producer Dudley Nichols Screenwriter Milton Krasner Director of Photography Arthur Hilton Editor Synopsis Christopher Cross, a quiet and staid cashier with dreams of becoming a painter, feels consumed by passion for the first time in his life when he meets pretty, manipulative Kitty. The two become involved, but Kitty is really in love with petty crook Johnny--she keeps Christopher around simply for his money. In order not to lose his precious mistress, Cross embezzles funds from his employer; he doesn't realize, however, that Kitty and Johnny are also getting rich on his paintings, which are becoming a huge success under Kitty's name. When Christopher's theft comes to light, he loses his job and his dignity. And when he seeks out Kitty for solace, he discovers her in Johnny's embrace. Furious, Christopher stabs Kitty repeatedly with an icepick. Then, he stands coldly by as Johnny is implicated, and finally executed, for the crime. Description In this remake of Jean Renoir's controversial 1931 film, LA CHIENNE, Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson), a quiet, staid cashier and dedicated Sunday painter, feels consumed by passion for the first time in his life when he meets pretty, manipulative Kitty. The two become involved, but Kitty is really in love with petty crook Johnny. She keeps Christopher around simply for his money. In order to impress his precious mistress, Cross embezzles funds from his employer. He doesn't realize, however, that Kitty and Johnny are also getting rich on his paintings, which are becoming a huge success under Kitty's name. When Christopher's theft comes to light, he loses his job and his dignity. And when he seeks out Kitty for solace, he discovers her in Johnny's embrace. The film explodes in its violent climax, and with it Lang creates perhaps his most chilling Film Noir work. The tightly structured story and the evocative paintings that lie symbolically at the center of the plot create a visual and psychological atmosphere of suspense, filled with double meanings and games of representation and appearance, all pointing toward a brutal final act, motivated by Cross' inner demons and repressed emotions. Film Notes Theatrical release: December 28, 1945. SCARLET STREETwas filmed in Los Angeles in 1945. SCARLET STREET was the first film in the partnership between Lang, leading lady Joan Bennet and her husband , producer Walter Wagner. Fritz Lang's SCARLET STREET has the same leading actors as his 1941 film, THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW. _____________ ____________ ____________ ___________ __________ _________ _________ ________ _______ _______ ________ _________ _________ __________ ___________ ___________ ____________ _Payment and Shipping Info ___________ __________ __________ ___________ ____________ ____________ _____________ ________________ Buyer to pay shipping and handling of $3.75.

Whether they_re looked at by today_s audiences as entertainment, historical or offensive, you can_t deny their existance or rarity. BUYERS NOTE: This tape is derived from a varierty of sources, as a result quality varies considerably from cartoon to cartoon. VIDEO CONTENT: _Rassling Match_ & _The Lion Tamer_ featuring Amos & Andy (the original actors from the radio series do these cartoons). Tom & Jerry in _Plane Dumb_ (two white guys donning black face to _blend in_ in Africa). Bugs Bunny in _All This And Rabbit Stew_ (Bugs being pursued by a black hunter) and War Bonds (Bugs doing a black face Al Jolson routine). The Walter Lantz cartoon _Scrub Me Mama With A Boogie Beat_. A 10 minute short called _Jungle Jitters_ about a salesman being captured by black headhunters and, the most famous (or infamous) of all, the Celebrity Pictures production of _Little Black Sambo_ VIDEO QUESTIONS: This write-up usually covers the most common video questions so please read on.. Video copy is new, VHS, SP standard mode NTSC (playable on all Canadian, U.S and standard Japanese VCR's) and is manufactured and distributed by our public domain company Buyers Gallery Video unless noted. The picture and audio quality on these tapes is overall good but bear in mind that these titles are made from vintage reels and the quality is indicative of the technology of the particular era, so please be realistic in your expectations and don_t expect DVD quality from films, in some cases, almost 100 years old. Any title that is _below par_ is noted in video description as best as possible.. Video comes in a hardshell plastic library case with the photo seen above printed on white stock. In the rare occasion of a defective tape it will be exchanged for the same title.. We DO NOT sell or wholesale to other video companies, sell throughs or video stores.

Without a story, dialogue, or characters, Koyaanisqatsi (1983) (the film's title is a Hopi word roughly translated into English as \"life out of balance\") is composed of nature imagery, manipulated in slow motion, double exposure or time lapse, juxtaposed with footage of humans' devastating environmental impact on the planet. Starting with an ancient rock wall painting, the film moves through sequences depicting clouds, waves, and other natural features, then into man-made landscapes such as buildings, earth-altering construction machinery, and cars. The message of director Godfrey Reggio is clear: humans are destroying the planet, and all of human progress is pointlessly foolish. Also notable for its intense, atmospheric score by new age composer Philip Glass, Koyaanisqatsi (1983) was a labor of love for Reggio, who spent several years filming it. The film was followed by sequels, Powaqqatsi (1988), Anima Mundi (1991) and Naqoyqatsi (1999). All movies are former Video Update rentals and have cut-box art. These particular movies are exceptionally clean minus a few stickers. All movies have been tested to insure a quality playback and are priced to MOOOVE!! So bid in confidence.

This item is obtained directly from our authorized wholesale distributor. It is new and unopened, in the original factory shrink wrap. These are not dubbed or copied, but are the genuine products available here in the U.S. Please beware of others' \"copied\" products. Starring: The Muppets NTSC format (US and Canada only) Color, HiFi Sound, Animated, NTSC Originally a special for HBO, this Jim Henson production (he also directed) was one of the first real forays into the more realistic, less vaudevillian direction for the Muppets. It also included Frank Oz (Muppeteer), Paul Williams (songs), and Jerry Juhl (script), some of the Muppet Show's usual suspects. Emmet Otter and his jug band are trying out in the local talent show, but they face fierce competition from a gang of toughs, the Riverbottom Gang and their rock band. Perhaps the most notable thing is the creation of a sense of poverty and want that suffuses the little production. Even Emmet's mother, who sacrifices her washtub to further Emmet's cause, gets in the act. Fine Christmas viewing for all ages. My sister, brother and I never missed this Muppet special when it used to air in the 70's. It remains a family favorite to this day, thanks to Nickolodeon re-runs and this edited-but-still-viable video copy. Emmet and his mother would like to \"just once,\" have a \"store-bought\" Christmas for each other. In our materialistic culture, the love these characters have for each other and their pleasure in the small wonders of life are a lesson to us all. The sweet-faced animal characters, their beautiful voices, and the message about true giving make this a fun and very meaningful holiday special. Thanks to Russell and Lillian Hoban, who wrote the wonderful book upon which this is based, and to Jim Henson and Paul Williams for bringing it to life. They've given us a great gift, and I can't wait to share it with my own children someday. \"Like a flower that has blossomed / In the dry and barren sand / We are born, and born again, most gracefully / So the winds of time will take us / With a sure and steady hand / When the river meets the sea.\" Payment options: Mastercard/Visa or E-Check through PayPal Our PAYPAL account = dsc3@georgetown.edu Money order Cash Personal or cashier's check Payment options for International buyers : Mastercard/Visa or E-Check through PayPal Our PAYPAL account = dsc3@georgetown.edu International money order in U.S. dollars Cash in U.S. Dollars Check drawn from a U.S. Bank PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS AFTER AUCTION END: Your total price = Auction Ending Price plus Shipping & Handling Watch for an e-mail which will arrive soon after auction has ended This e-mail will contain all payment instructions you will need Please do not e-mail us asking us to confirm final price/payment details These details will be enclosed in the e-mail Payment needs to be received in 10 business days Buyer to pay $4.00 for shipping and handling within the U.S. Please click here to see my other similar items currently on auction.

It is size medium, 6-12 months. It is solid white. It has long sleeves and a turtleneck style collar. It snaps at the shoulder for easy dressing. My favorite feature is the \"onsie-styling\" that snaps between the legs, so it doesn't come untucked! This top is 100% cotton. The classic styling and basic layette color make is very versatile. A great coordinate for many of your little one's clothing. Definately a wardrobe MUST for your baby! This shirt is brand new with tags still attached. I bought this to coordinate with a pair of gray velvet Baby Gap biboveralls and a red plaid Baby Gap shirt. The three pieces were to be worn together as an outfit. The white turtleneck with the biboveralls and the plaid shirt on top, unbuttoned, as an \"over shirt.\" It really looked great on the store display manequin. Unfortunately, it just didn't get cold enough here last winter to wear this layered look, so this turtleneck was never worn.

It has three snap buttons running down from the collar. The overalls are fleecy and warm. They have two snaps on each side so they can be adjusted in case of growth spurts. A V with a teddy bear and football accents the center of the outfit with the words \"Varsity Cub\" underneath. This outfit is in great condition. Almost like new. I paid $32.99. Size 24 months. This shirt will look very in season for the holidays coming upon us. It's very warm and fuzzy in a nice shade of green. In the center of the shirt is a plaid bear. The same plaid trims the hem of the shirt. The jeans are in great condition with very minimal fading in the knees. A terrific little boy outfit! The shirt is 24 months and the jeans are 2T, but my son wore them both together. This shirt is like a thermal fabric in a deep reddish burgundy shade. It has blue trim around the collar, yellow trim around one wrist and green trim around the other wrist. The overalls are just you classic denim. This outfit is in great condition. Size 24 months. The green pajamas with purple trim are by Gerber and are in very nice condition. Size 2T. The red pajamas are by Carter's and are in very nice condition. Size 2T. The shirt is kind of fleecy, in yellow/gold, navy and red. A zipper runs down from the collar and it reads: \"Bear rides his bike on the trails\" across the middle of the shirt and shows various pictures pertaining to trails and woods. The pants are navy with a red drawstring waistband and yellow cuffing at the ankles. This outfit looks almost brand new. It is by 2nd Step and was purchased at Kohl's Department Store for $32.99. Size 24 months. This adorable lion sweatsuit outfit is just as precious as can be. The shirt has a lion on the front. If you pressed the nose it used to roar, but the sound effect is no longer working. A hood is attached to the shirt with a fringed mane and ears. The pants are plain sweats the same color as the shirt. This outfit is in nice condition, except it does have those little \"nubbies\" that sweats always get after repeated washings. Size 2T. Also included in this lot which isn't pictured is a burgundy colored Gap turtleneck in size XXS. It is in excellent, like new condition.

Canada and International bidders pay the actual shipping charge plus insurance and handling expenses ( CLICK HERE for more shipping, payment and auction details). Due to several non-paying overseas bidders, an International bidder must have a positive feedback of 20+ or email us first for permission to bid.

Although our website may have a similar item available to the one that is on auction, we do not substitute/exchange items or sizes, so be sure you are bidding on the correct item and size. All auction items have been prepackaged and can originate from different warehouses, therefore we can not combine multiple auctions to reduce shipping.

For faster shipping, Visa, Mastercard and eChecks are accepted securely through PayPal for shipping to confirmed domestic addresses. Please don't be one of the people left out in the cold after the auction because you were unable to bid at the last second and missed the item you wanted! If you proxy bid and secretly put in the highest you are willing to go, the system will work for you if you are away and place a high bid when it is needed to keep you a winner (this keeps the bid snipers from beating you at the last second just before the auction ends)!

B- jade & C-jade The Jadeite showing up on market presently can be classified into A jade, B jade and C jade. A- jade indicates the natural jadeite without undergoing any artificial treatment, alteration or enhancement. Such a kind of natural jadeite does not change with the passage of time. It can be preserved forever and wears well. B- Jade is defined as the natural jadeite having undergone a process of acid treatment, removed the impurities and impregnated with colloidal silica or resin. Normally, this kind of jadeite will turn out yellow gradually in 5-10 years of time and then the surface color will come off due to the ageing of resin or colloid. Meanwhile, the composition of inherent texture of jadeite has been destroyed during the acid treatment which affects immediately its durability. C-Jade is specified as the natural jadeite having undergone artificial treatment, colloid impregnation plus adding the new pigment substance.( We say dyed color) We may also say that not only its internal texture has been undermined but also its internal color was artificially added in.

Be careful! Pure gold can be flattened into a foil that is only 5/1,000,000 of an inch thick. \"100 % gold\" could only mean \"plated with gold\". The price for the gold in a 23K chain is non negotiable. There is no wholesale or retail; everyone pays the published price. However, the price of the gold jewelry is based on the cost of the gold and the cost of the workmanship that went into making the piece. Thailand ranks as the second largest jewelry exporting country in the world. \"Thai Gold\" is .965 fine, a little over 23K. The alloy makes the gold harder so it stands up to wear much better than the very soft 24K gold. In other Asian countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore, the gold shops sell only 24K gold and is sold by the \"Tael\" which is 37.5 grams. \"Baht Gold\" refers to \"Thai Gold\" .950 pure or better and is sold by the Baht weight which = 15.2 grams.

It is a size x small but fits like the rest. The third item is a dress. She wore this with a shirt underneath(windy days) and a pair of leggings underneath. Beautiful blue with yellow flowers on pocket. Snaps in the back are yellow(5 in all) and 3 have a tiny scratch pin size mark. Condition -The dress and the cardigan have no stains or holes anywhere. Like I said the other shirt I threw in because the cuffs have a discoloration from playing outside but isnt noticable. Just a extra item for play or what not. All snaps and zippers are in perfect working order. All have normal wash wear. Payment -Paypal, Bidpay, Billpoint and money orders only. Payment due within 10 days of first email. Shipping rate -$3.50 Priority mail (2-3 days). Return Policy -Conditional return. If item was not authentic or as described, I will return you money back minus shipping.
